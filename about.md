This book has been made available for political scholars as a document of early 21st century Scottish socialist thinking. It is divided into four, roughly equal-sized chapters: the consciousness of the wrongs of massive inequality in wealth and power, together with engaging and lively excursions into theory, making plain the case for the larger picture of socialism, and the argument for what can be achieved within the framework of an independent Scottish socialist republic.

It successfully argues for the socialist transformation of society - dismantling the free-market ideology that now hampers the development of science, health, manufacturing, food production, education, information technology and telecommunications sectors.

Imagine explicitly avoids fractious militancy. It prefers instead to argue the case to voters, and specifically those who seek to vote not just for a parties of splinter protest, but ones with the potential for government.
