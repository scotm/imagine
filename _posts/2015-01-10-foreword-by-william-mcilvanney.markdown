Thanks to the widespread acceptance of monetarist theories in recent times, official political debate has been largely reduced to a kind of non-dialectical materialism. There has developed a tendency to judge a society by how much money it can generate, no matter how few bank accounts the bulk of that money comes to rest in. The pursuit of capital for its own sake has kicked up a drifting mist of pragmatism which has obscured from us our deeper aspirations, like fallout that deforms our dreams. The result has been to marginalise the importance of reconstructing society towards a more justly shared community of living.

One reason why I welcome this book is that it reinstates the demand for social justice at the centre of political debate, which is where it belongs. Social justice is not some optional extra which can be fitted in once we get our sums right. It is the very principle which will determine the rightness or wrongness of our sums.

It is heartening to see these authors start from this premise. Chapter by chapter, the issues they cover will seem to map out terrain with which we are familiar but the angle of total commitment to social justice from which they view them may give us fresh perspectives. Certainly, in these writings, some things which contemporary attitudes might have taken for natural landmarks, as inevitable as mountains, can be seen as man-made excrescences, as avoidable as slagheaps.

It wonâ€™t be necessary to agree with all the arguments here to see the validity of this book. What it most importantly does is to demand that we extend our concern beyond the efficiency of the economy towards the deeper purposes such efficiency might serve. It is an attempt, through a perception of where we are, to arrive at some sort of vision of where we might be.

Such vision was never more necessary than it is now, when many of our aspirations seem to have a horizon of about six inches. The idea of a just society is a bit like the Kraken. We have never found it but we can imagine it out there. If we can imagine it, we should keep looking. This book is still searching. I respect the search.
