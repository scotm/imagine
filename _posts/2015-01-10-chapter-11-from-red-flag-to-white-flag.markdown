IT’S FAST-FORWARD TO the year 2010 and the Tories are back in government. After losing the 2001 general election, the party reinvented itself. First it decided to break out of the ghetto of its suburban heartlands and began to champion instead the rights of the working class and the poor. The New Tory Party was born. It elected as its leader a former miner from Tyneside who spoke with a broad Geordie accent and had been educated at his local state comprehensive school.

Gradually, the party turned its back on its traditional supporters, the rich and powerful. New Tory leaders began to write articles in the Scottish Socialist Voice, the Morning Star, and other left-wing publications, arguing that capitalism was now ‘irrelevant and out of date’. They toured trade-union conferences winning rapturous applause for their assurances that the Tory Party had become the new party of the working class and the trade unions.

When he eventually swept to power, the New Tory leader appointed a range of left-wing trade-union activists to key Cabinet posts. ‘We live in a class-ridden society,’ he declared as he unveiled his plan to bring back into public ownership the assets that had been privatised by previous governments. The New Tory government then set about levying punitive taxes on big business and establishing special anti-fraud squads designed to root out tax embezzlement by the rich. Tory candidates who protested against these measures or dared to praise capitalism or private profiteering were branded as traitors to the New Tory project and driven out of the party.

Far-fetched? Maybe. Except that it’s already happened – in reverse. Tony Blair likes to portray himself as a radical pioneer, bravely blazing a new trail into unexplored territory. As everyone knows, the Labour leader is addicted to the word ‘New’. Every speech is peppered with references to the New Millennium, the New Century, New Britain, the New Economy, New Thinking, New Ideas, New Politics, New Policies, New Labour. In one interview, he even managed to make a reference to ‘our New Traditions’.

But there is nothing at all new about New Labour. It is old Toryism in a New Suit, Thatcherism with a grinning face. Tony Blair is in essence a political used-car salesman, who has taken the battered old wreck of Thatcherism, painted over the rust, and changed the mileage on the clock.

Tony Blair makes no bones about where he stands. ‘The old ideological conflict between Left and Right is over,’ he claims. ‘The conflict between capital and labour is a thing of the past.’ These are remarkable statements from the leader of a political party that was formed by the trade unions to provide political representation for the working class. It is like the Pope declaring that ‘the old theological conflict between Christianity and atheism is over’, or the scientist Stephen Hawkins announcing that ‘the law of gravity is a thing of the past’.1

Many socialists hold Blair personally responsible for tearing out the party’s socialist heart and soul. They contrast him with the first-ever Labour leader. James Keir Hardie was a cautious and moderate man, a devoted Christian, and a fierce supporter of the temperance movement, to boot. Beside Blair, his courage shines out like brilliant sunshine beside a flickering candle.

Keir Hardie lashed out against injustice at every turn. He backed the Suffragettes, demanded that the rich be taxed to the hilt, denounced inherited privilege, lambasted the monarchy and opposed the imperialist slaughter of the First World War. He backed independence for India 50 years before it was granted and denounced apartheid in South Africa 80 years before the system was finally dismantled.

The Tory press barons of the day hated and feared Keir Hardie with a vengeance. They daily spewed out vitriol against this former Lanarkshire miner, who had been sent out to become the family breadwinner at the age of seven. Hardie merely shrugged his shoulders and dismissed the press hysteria-mongers: ‘If my enemies start to praise me, that’s when I’ll start to worry.’

By contrast, Tony Blair is fêted by the rich and powerful. For the pampered privileged minority who own Britain, Tony is ‘one of us’, a man who can be trusted wholeheartedly to stand on the side of wealth and power when the chips are down.

The transnational press baron, Rupert Murdoch, whose UK subsidiary, News Corporation, makes a £1 billion a year profit and fails to pay a penny tax to the British Exchequer, is worshipped like a king by the New Labour leader. Blair’s closest political associates include grocery tycoon, Lord Sainsbury; multimillionaire stockbroker, Gavyn Davies; Lord Simon, who butchered 65,000 jobs at BP; Virgin boss, Richard Branson; motor-racing billionaire, Bernie Ecclestone; and former media mogul, Lord Gus MacDonald.

But, although Tony Blair may appear as the living embodiment of the Tory takeover of Labour, there are far more powerful forces shaping New Labour than spin doctors and used-car salesmen. The New Labour project is part of a wholesale international migration from Left to Right as a vast procession of former workers’ parties across Europe tear down the red flag and hoist the white handkerchief.

Far from standing in the vanguard of ‘modernisation’, New Labour is lagging behind its Spanish counterpart by almost two decades. Felipe Gonzales, the leader of PSOE, the Spanish Socialist Workers’ Party, was a Blairite when Tony Blair himself still professed to be a socialist. Under Gonzales, Spanish unemployment rose to 22 per cent, and his party is back in opposition.

In Portugal, Greece, Germany, Sweden, and a host of other countries across Europe and further afield – for example, Australia and New Zealand – an identical process has occurred. Parties which once proudly described themselves as ‘socialist’, or at least as social democratic, have turned into fervent free-marketers.

This mass capitulation to capitalism is not simply a product of copy-cat politics. It is rooted in the changes in the global capitalist economy over the past few decades, which leave no scope for muddled moderation.

In the 1930s, the poetic genius Hugh MacDiarmid wrote: ‘I’ll hae nae haufway hoose; I’ll aye be whaur extremes meet.’2 This could be the leitmotif of global politics in the 21st century, as snarling capitalism, red in tooth and claw, runs amok.

In the past, Labour proudly proclaimed that its mission was to achieve socialism in Britain. In 1947, the party even published its own centenary edition of the Communist Manifesto, the famous clarion call to revolution written by Marx and Engels in the mid 19th century. The foreword declared, ‘In presenting this centenary volume of the Communist Manifesto, the Labour Party acknowledges its indebtedness to Marx and Engels as two men who have been the inspiration of the whole working class movement.’

In reality, although Labour was a socialist party in words, it was, in practice, a social democratic party. Social democracy was in essence a more restrained and civilised version of the capitalist free market. It’s aim was to reform capitalism, to make the system more just, more humane, more concerned for the welfare of the poor.

Governments based on these principles did introduce important reforms that vastly improved the quality of life of ordinary people. In Britain, the 1945–51 Labour government imposed hefty taxes on the rich. It introduced the two greatest social reforms carried out by any government in the 300-year history of the British state – the welfare state and the National Health Service.

In Germany and Scandinavia, reforming governments poured resources into health, housing, education, pensions, and welfare. For decades on end, social democracy reigned supreme throughout most of Northern Europe, with even Tory governments adapting themselves to this left-of-centre post-war consensus.

These governments also began to move away from unbridled free-market capitalism. Some essential loss-making industries and services were nationalised. In Britain, coal, steel, electricity, gas, and the railways were taken over by the state. This was termed ‘the mixed economy’.

But pouring a bottle of whisky into Loch Katrine doesn’t transform it into a mixed reservoir. Nor is it possible to achieve semi-socialism. The essential ingredients of socialism – mass democracy social equality, and a co-ordinated harmonious economy – were absent in these societies. The new nationalised industries were run as bureaucratic monopolies while the bulk of these ‘mixed economies’ continued to be run from the boardrooms and stock exchanges.

In Britain, the social democrats were not even genuine social democrats. Feudal institutions such as the monarchy and the House of Lords continued to thrive under a succession of Labour governments. Inherited wealth and privilege remained woven into the fabric of British society.

Some reforming Labour politicians did have grander ambitions. The best of these had the idea that it would be possible to evolve gradually towards some form of socialism. In the words of a post-war parody of the socialist anthem, ‘The Red Flag’, ‘We’ll change the country bit by bit; so nobody will notice it.’ But instead of crawling forward towards socialism, Labour governments in Britain and abroad have since galloped backwards towards classical free-market Toryism.

The start of this process can be traced back as far as the mid-1970s, when the long gentle upward curve of capitalism was abruptly interrupted by an earth-shattering economic crisis. In Britain, a Labour government had been elected in 1974, pledged to carry out ‘a fundamental and irreversible shift in the balance of wealth and power in favour of working people and their families’. It also pledged to bring about full employment, an expansion of public services, increased pensions and benefits, and the nationalisation of North Sea oil and other key sectors of the economy.3

By 1979, when Labour left office, there were twice as many people unemployed as there had been in 1974. With the unelected bankers of the International Monetary Fund holding a gun to its head, the Labour government had forced through the biggest programme of cuts in health, education, and local-government expenditure ever seen in post-war Britain. It had mobilised the army onto the streets to break strikes of binmen and firefighters.

North Sea oil and other sectors of the economy, which Labour had promised to nationalise, remained in big-business hands. Instead of a redistribution of wealth and power from rich to poor, there took place a redistribution of wealth and power from poor to rich. The government finally crumbled in the wake of the so-called ‘Winter of Discontent’, when the patience of millions of pitifully low-paid public-sector workers finally snapped.

From then on, nothing was ever the same again. Thatcher took power, and the long post-war consensus was ripped to shreds. She waged the most vicious social war ever seen in post-war Europe against the working class and its organisations. But, like Blair today, Thatcher was merely implementing an agenda dictated by the needs of an economic system battling for survival. To one degree or another, the same agenda was pursued across Europe, North and South America, and Australasia.

In a bizarre historical twist, some of the most rabidly Thatcherite governments on the planet had originally been elected as workers’ parties committed to social democracy. In New Zealand, for example, a Labour government went further than even Thatcher dared to venture. Hospitals and schools were converted into commercial businesses; taxes on big business and the rich were cut by 50 per cent; collective bargaining was effectively outlawed with every worker in the public and private sector placed on an individual contract. One of the most comprehensive welfare states in the world was whittled down to a Latin American level.

In Europe too, the same trend unfolded, although never carried through to the same extreme as in New Zealand. In Britain, the political centre of gravity has shifted so far to the right that even an old-style Labour moderate such as Lord Hattersley is now ridiculed within his own party as a left-wing dinosaur. Even in its Scandinavian heartlands, social democracy has been abandoned.

In the ferocious new world of hi-tech, turbocharged, deregulated global capitalism, the international political and business elite has decided there is no longer any room for sentimental notions such as social justice or wealth redistribution.

Following a meeting of the World Economic Forum attended by 1000 top corporate executives in January 2000, the respected British economist. Will Hutton, who yearns for a return to some form of social democracy, observed, ‘It would take an intellectual atom bomb along with gigantic riots to force global business leaders to change course.’4

Professor John Gray, yet another fierce critic of unregulated free-market capitalism, is even more pessimistic: ‘Social democracy has been removed from the agenda of history.’ He argues that ‘many of the changes produced, accelerated or reinforced by New Right policies are irreversible … Those who imagine that there can be a return to the “normal politics” of post-war economic management are deluding themselves and others … Global mobility of capitalism has made the central policies of European social democracy unworkable.’5

When New Labour Chancellor Gordon Brown intones that ‘there will be no return to the old tax-and-spend policies of the past’, he is simply reciting his lines. The script is no longer written by chancellors or prime ministers; it is written by corporate vampires who are no longer prepared to pay taxes to finance extravagant spending on such fripperies as welfare benefits, health, and education. As the famous economist JK Galbraith points out, ‘The rich are no longer prepared to pay for the poor.’6

There is nothing that any government can do to alter that – other than stand up to the rich and challenge the very existence of the global capitalist system. Sadly, there is as much likelihood of New Labour taking such a stance as there is of Bill Gates donating his entire personal fortune to Oxfam.
