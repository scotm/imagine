IN THE 1950s, after the Authors’ Union of East Germany, a front for the ruling Communist Party, published a leaflet condemning a general strike of workers, the celebrated poet and playwright, Bertolt Brecht, wrote:

> ‘After the Uprising on June 17th

> Had leaflets distributed in the  
> Stalinallee which said that the people  
> Had forfeited the government’s confidence  
> And could only win it back  
> By redoubled labour. Wouldn’t it  
> Be simpler in that case if the government  
> Dissolved the people and  
> Elected another?’1

For socialists, democracy is not an optional extra, like a preference for sugar in tea. Socialism without free elections, without free trade unions, without free speech, is not socialism.

Back in the 19th century, Karl Marx, when he read the policies of a political party that claimed to stand on his ideas, commented: ‘If that’s Marxism, I’m no Marxist.’ In the 20th century, millions of people in the West decided that they were not socialists, even though they instinctively sympathised with the ideals of socialism, such as equality, democracy, co-operation, and solidarity. And the reason they rejected socialism was because they were told that the Soviet Union was a socialist state.

It suited the rulers of the Soviet Union, and of the other states that later modelled themselves on the Soviet Union, to portray themselves as socialist. And it also suited the rulers of the capitalist West to portray these hideously repressive regimes as socialist. ‘If you don’t like capitalism, that’s the alternative – salt mines and labour camps, repression, and uniformity. That’s socialism!’

In truth, the Soviet Union and the other drab monolithic states, run by grey bureaucratic cliques, had as much in common with socialism as cyanide has with champagne. Under the rule of the tin-pot dictators who ran these countries, genuine socialist dissidents suffered imprisonment, torture, exile and execution for daring to demand democratic rights.

Meanwhile the bureaucrats who ran these countries and their vast entourage of hangers-on accumulated personal riches beyond the wildest dreams of those they ruled over. When the Ceaucescu government in Romania was toppled on Christmas Day 1989, ordinary Romanians were left stunned at the extent of the personal wealth that this ‘communist’ dictator and his family had hoarded for themselves. While the mass of population were rationed to a single light bulb, the Ceaucescu family were discovered to have owned thousands of crystal chandeliers. The tyrant had his own personal marble-lined nuclear bunker. He had specially reserved deer forests for hunting, while the mass of the population lived at the edge of starvation.

Absolute equality could never be achieved within the borders of a single country, even one based on the principles of genuine socialism. For a transitional period, at least, differentials in salaries would be necessary to prevent the possibility of a brain-drain of key specialists.

Full economic equality could only be attainable on the basis of an advance in productivity and living standards. This in turn would require the victory of socialism on a continental, or even worldwide, scale and the establishment of an international commonwealth of socialist nations.

But the general trend within any genuine socialist state would be away from inequality towards equality. In the Soviet Union and its Eastern European satellites, the trend was in the opposite direction. The highest stratum in Soviet society had begun to live lifestyles akin to the ruling classes of America and Europe. In the Soviet Union itself, there were 100,000 millionaires under communism. In the late 1980s, it was estimated that three per cent of the population of the country owned 80 per cent of savings in banks.

It was not always that way. In the early days, the original aim of the Russian Revolution had been to blaze the trail towards a new socialist world based on co-operation, equality and democracy. Across Europe, millions of young men were being sent to the mass slaughterhouses of Flanders and Armentiers. Back home, their families were living in abominable slums and suffering terrible poverty. In Russia, the people had for generations lived under the iron heel of Tsarism. When this rotting edifice was brought crashing to the ground in 1917, there was mass jubilation among working people from one end of Europe to the other.

In one country after another, workers’ uprisings sought to emulate the Bolshevik revolution in Russia. In Glasgow, the legend of Red Clydeside was born 14 months later, as tens of thousands of workers took on the might of the British government. Panic-stricken, the British Prime Minister Lloyd George mobilised 12,000 troops armed to the teeth with machine guns, tanks and aeroplanes from England into the city and locked up local regiments in Maryhill Barracks for fear they would join the workers’ revolt.

In a secret memorandum to the French Prime Minister, Georges Clemenceau, Lloyd George expressed utter despair: ‘The whole of Europe is filled with the spirit of Revolution. There is a deep sense not only of discontent, but of anger and revolt … The whole existing order in its political, social, and economic aspects is being questioned by the masses of the population from one end of Europe to another’.2

But, outside Russia, the forces opposing capitalism lacked the strength, cohesion, and determination to win. The Russian Revolution was left isolated. And trying to build socialism in a backward country like Russia 1917 was like trying to build a fire in a waterlogged swamp in the pouring driving rain without a stick of wood, a teaspoonful of fuel, or a single match. The material foundations for a thriving socialist democracy simply did not exist in a state which still had one foot in the Dark Ages.

As a result, the dream of socialism was usurped by the monstrosity of Stalinism. An entire generation of genuine socialists were systematically annihilated, along with millions of ordinary Russian men and women who perished in the gulags and concentration camps. The same pattern was repeated in one form or another throughout Eastern Europe, and in other totalitarian states, such as China, which later imitated Stalin’s Soviet Union.

Without either the whip of the capitalist market or the check of genuine democracy, corruption, waste, and bureaucratic incompetence ran rampant in these states. Yet as a result of the abolition of capitalism, the Soviet Union achieved spectacular social and economic advances. In 1917, the country had been at the same economic level as India. By the 1960s, it had risen to become the world’s second industrial and military superpower after the United States.

In the 50 years up to 1963, Soviet industrial output multiplied more than 52 times over. In contrast, over the same period, industrial output in the US grew just six times over, while in Britain it barely doubled. By the early 1960s, the Soviet Union had risen from a state of medieval barbarism to become the first country in the world to launch an artificial satellite and to send an astronaut into space.

For decades, the Soviet Union competed with and even outstripped the West, industry for industry. Capitalist economists today refer to the ‘miraculous’ American economic boom of the past eight years with the US economy growing at around three per cent a year. But throughout the whole of the 1950s the Soviet economy grew at an average of ten per cent a year. In the 1960s, it grew at seven per cent a year; in the 1970s at five per cent.3

Living standards of ordinary people improved phenomenally. From a country where cannibalism was rife in some regions right up until 1917, one in three of the population had a university degree by the 1980s. Gas, electricity, and local telephone calls were provided free. Health, education, and public-sector housing were all of superior quality to the West. In East Germany and European Russia, living standards leapfrogged ahead of Britain.

What made these gains even more incredible was that they were achieved under the suffocating rule of a bureaucratic clique that strangled initiative and stifled individual flair. The ruling bureaucracy also displayed an unhealthy obsession with stark statistics. Social, human, and environmental considerations were subordinated to the achievement of production targets set by Moscow. Vast quantities of unwanted goods were churned out of the factories, while there were permanent shortages of many essential foodstuffs.

The environment was literally laid waste. In some parts of Eastern Europe, the rain that fell from the skies was jet black. In Ceaucescu’s Romania, beautiful medieval cathedrals were razed to the ground and replaced with giant concrete blocks, each identical to one another. Babies are still being born today in Belarus and Ukraine with limbs and organs missing as a result of the radioactivity released into the atmosphere when the Chernobyl nuclear reactor exploded in 1986.

Eventually, in the 1980s, even economic growth ground to a halt. As America, under Reagan, intensified the arms to frightening proportions, the Soviet economy was drained of resources as it strove to compete. For a long stretch of the 1980s, the US government was spending a colossal $1 billion a day on armaments. The Soviet government tried to match this expenditure, and bankrupted itself in the process.

At the same time, faced with the technological revolution which first began to unfold in the mid-1970s, the Soviet government stood paralysed with fear, like a rabbit caught in the glare of a car’s headlights. In any totalitarian state, information systems are rigidly controlled by the government. In the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, every typewriter and photocopier had to be registered. No newspapers could be published and no TV or radio programme could be broadcast without official permission.

But no society that relies for survival on mind control could ever be capable of developing information technology, no matter how many brilliant scientists and technicians it has trained. For Orwellian states based on repression and fear, the free flow of information is like a lethal poison surging through the bloodstream.

The stagnation of the Soviet and Eastern European economies from the 1980s onwards paved the way in turn for a huge upsurge of political dissent, which embraced national minorities, environmentalists, and pro-democracy campaigners. Eventually the whole project unravelled, culminating in the tearing down of the Berlin Wall and the disintegration of the Soviet Union itself.

For tens of millions across Eastern Europe, the promised free-market Garden of Eden has turned into a vision of hell. The Scottish journalist, John Lloyd, one of the intellectual cheerleaders of capitalism, set out the stark facts in an article in the New York Times in 1999:

> ‘Russians, free to get richer, are poorer. The wealth of the nation has shrunk. The top 10 per cent is reckoned to possess 50 per cent of the nation’s wealth; the bottom 40 per cent less than 20. Somewhere between 30 and 40 million people live below the poverty line – defined as around $30 a month. The gross domestic product has shrunk every year except one – 1997 – when it grew, at best by one per cent. Unemployment, officially non-existent in Soviet times, is now 12 per cent and may officially be 25 per cent. Men die, on average, in their late 50s. Diseases like tuberculosis and diphtheria have reappeared; servicemen suffer malnutrition; the population shrinks rapidly.’

Welcome to capitalism.

Moscow today is a cross between modern Calcutta, with its teeming poverty, and 1920s Chicago, with its rampant gangsterism. Economists estimate that two thirds of all businesses, 400 banks and several dozen stock exchanges are run by the country’s 150 Mafia gangs. Up to 40 per cent of the country’s Gross Domestic Product is in the hands of organised crime syndicates.

A new mega-billionaire elite has emerged, ripping off the country’s assets right, left, and centre. Ten so-called entrepreneurs are believed to have salted way $1.2 trillion in Swiss banks while the Russian economy fell apart. The most notorious member of this new ‘kleptocracy’ is Boris Berezovsky, known as ‘the Godfather of the Kremlin’. Berezovsky owns banks, TV stations, newspapers, oil companies, car dealerships, and airlines. He has a 150-strong private army, many of them KGB-trained assassins and, according to the influential Forbes magazine, ‘he has left a trail of corpses in his wake’.4

As it happens, Mr Berezovsky’s closest business collaborator is a well-known international celebrity. Step forward, Rupert Murdoch, the Australian-turned-American Thatcherite-turned-Blairite media mogul.

Prior to 1990, the Soviet Union was neither socialist nor capitalist. A feudal-style hierarchy of rank and privilege was grafted onto a grotesquely centralised command economy. Although the top tiers of this hierarchy owned vast wealth, they were not capitalists in the proper sense of the word. A capitalist is not just someone who is wealthy. In the West today, there are wealthy pop stars, film stars, and footballers, but Elton John, Sean Connery, and David Beckham are not capitalists. Their wealth does not derive from ownership of stocks and shares, or from employing and exploiting the labour of other people, as is the case with a capitalist.

In the former Soviet Union, there were no stock exchanges before the 1990s. But, like caterpillars turning into butterflies, an army of Stalinist bureaucrats turned themselves into private capitalists as the Russian economy was privatised.

An article in The Economist in 1994 pointed out that the Young Communist League (the Komsomol) ‘is the Harvard or Yale of the new business culture, churning out privileged entrepreneurs … Komsomol leaders have set up huge commercial banks that are beginning to dominate the financial scene.’

In the past, one of the abusive epithets hurled by the media in this country against left-wing socialists was ‘Trotskyite’. Most of the journalists who used this term had no understanding of who Leon Trotsky actually was, or what he stood for. In fact, the popular revolutionary leader of 1917 was, in the words of Tony Benn, ‘the Soviet Union’s first dissident’. In George Orwell’s classic work, Nineteen Eighty-Four the hero, Emmanuel Goldstein, was based on Leon Trotsky. ‘The Book’ referred to throughout Orwell’s lucid and gripping polemic against totalitarianism was Revolution Betrayed, Trotsky’s searing indictment of Stalinism.5

In the whole of human history, there is no comparable example of such immense resources of power and propaganda being directed against a single individual. Seven of Trotsky’s secretaries and four of his children were murdered by the Soviet Union’s apparatus of terror. Throughout his long battle against Stalinist tyranny, the capitalist West sided with Stalin. Churchill denounced Trotsky as ‘the Ogre of Europe’ and praised ‘the reasonable Mr Stalin’. The British Labour Party refused to support Trotsky’s request for political asylum, as did every government in the world except that of the Republic of Mexico.

In 1940, Trotsky was finally hunted down and assassinated by a Soviet agent. But ideas can’t be murdered. Sure, times have moved on. Certainly, the old political slogans of the 1920s and 1930s cannot simply be regurgitated in the new world of the 21st century. Nonetheless, the basic ideals defended by Trotsky – socialist democracy and working-class internationalism – are even more relevant today than they were then. And his critique of Stalinism, as explained in depth in Revolution Betrayed, remains to this day the most powerful and plausible explanation of what went wrong in the Soviet Union.
