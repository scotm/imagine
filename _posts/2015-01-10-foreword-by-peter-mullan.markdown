I didn’t want to write this. I’ll be honest and say I did everything I could to avoid it. Not because I don’t agree with what is written – I do.

I just hate the idea that my name is deemed necessary to endorse something as universal, as vital, as important, as socialism. Especially socialism in a Scottish context.

My name means fuck all. My own children don’t even have my name! They have their mother’s surname and that’s not because we are separated (we’ve been together twelve years) but because I know to the core of my being that they are part of me as I am part of them and that’s all that matters to me. The name, the label, is irrelevant.

Imagine – A Socialist Vision for the 21st Century, as created by Tommy and Alan, is their work, not mine and it can stand on its own. These are two highly intelligent, committed socialists, for whom I have the deepest respect and have known since I was a Young Socialist in the late 1970s. So if I were you I’d skip this bit and go straight to the first chapter.

For those of you who, for whatever reasons, want to know my opinion, I feel obliged to take note of historian E H Carr who said, ‘Before you can understand history you must first understand the historian.’ So as quickly as I can, I’ll introduce myself.

I am any, one and very possibly none of the following: son of a nurse and a toolmaker, the brother of three sisters and four brothers, a pupil at Lourdes Primary, Our Lady of the Rosary, Lourdes Secondary, a Catholic (surprise, surfuckinprise), a paperboy, a grocer’s assistant, a shelf stacker in the old Co-op in Paisley Road West, a baby-sitter for a neurosurgeon’s weans, a labourer in a bed-making factory, a would-be playwright, a student, a check-out operator in the hypermarket, a residential care worker, a barman in the Viking Bar in Maryhill, a volunteer in a homeless unit in London, a disco dancer, a graduate of Glasgow Uni, a psychiatric patient at the Southern General Hospital, a film school reject, a prison visitor, a night porter, a drama worker in the Wine Alley, a researcher and tutorial assistant at Glasgow University, a drama worker for the WEA, a founder member of the Redheads, a sitcom writer, a professional actor, unemployed, an actor with Wildcat Theatre Co, an actor with the Tron Theatre Co, an anti-Poll-Tax campaigner, a television writer, unemployed, a father, a short film-maker, an orphan, a panic-attack sufferer, a flyophobe, a feature film-maker, an actor with awards attached, the guy in The Steamie, the guy wi’ the rubber legs in The Celtic Story, the guy that stood next to Davy McKay in Braveheart, the big baldy bastard that wis in Trainspotting, that actor cunt that was in My Name Is Orphans.

So bearing all that in mind, here are my thoughts on this book. Like I said, it’s been written by two men for whom I have THE DEEPEST REGARD. Reading the book, I found myself having to make the mental leap from ideals of socialism to the practicalities of how they may be applied in 21st-century Scotland. There are minor details I don’t agree with, some I want to know more about, the vast majority I support completely.

It’s a great feeling and a little daunting to map out the practice and means of a Scottish Socialist Republic. Great, because I honestly believe it’s possible. Daunting because I honestly believe it’s possible.

As a product of that none-too-subtle slavery that is known as Western Capitalist Democracy, you’re always conscious that socialist ideals will remain just and only that. An ideal. Something that can never actually be.

That the task is too great, the enemy too powerful. So let’s rally around the odd issue, go on the occasional demo, attend the odd meeting and, when times are really hard, let’s retreat to soap-opera socialism where every worker loves his mammy and every capitalist hates his da (but really their ma and da were lovers so we’re aw brothers after ahhh).

The most exciting thing about this book is that it has the nerve to apply socialist principles to present-day Scotland. It presents a programme around which democracy can be applied. By reading it you can begin to take part in something genuinely revolutionary: a working, participatory Scottish Socialist Republic. A creation of our own.
