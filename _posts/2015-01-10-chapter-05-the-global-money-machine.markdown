*‘THE ONE AND only responsibility of business is to make as much money as possible for its shareholders.’* The honesty and clarity of this statement, by economist Milton Friedman, the guru of Thatcherism, leaves no room for misunderstanding.[1](../references/notes.html#chapter-5-1)

Friedman, hailed by the rich and powerful across the globe as the greatest economic philosopher of the 20th century, doesn’t try to pull the wool over anyone’s eyes by pretending that capitalism could ever have a social conscience. In fact, he explicitly denounces the idea that businesses should display any social responsibility to the wider community, the environment or the workforce as ‘a fundamentally subversive doctrine’.[2](../references/notes.html#chapter-5-2)

When he makes this observation, Milton Friedman is not just voicing an opinion, he is stating a fact. Some well-meaning politicians and writers would like big business to behave more honourably. But asking corporate capitalism to behave humanely is like asking a stone statue to shed tears. That’s not because the bosses that run the business empires are necessarily malevolent by nature – although undoubtedly the corporate boardrooms contain more than their share of strutting would-be Mussolinis.

But there are others who profess to be sincere followers of the carpenter of Nazareth who – if even some of the tales of his life are true – was an early revolutionary who stood up for the poor and downtrodden against the Roman Empire and its henchmen. In the gospel of Saint Luke he is quoted as saying, ‘It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God.’

One rich man who believes that he will enter the Kingdom of God is Scotland’s wealthiest man, Brian Souter. A member of the fundamentalist Baptist sect, the Church of the Nazarene, Mr Souter feels so strongly about his Christian beliefs that he recently threatened to spend the whole of his vast fortune fighting to keep Section 28, which prevents teachers from acknowledging the existence of homosexuality. If necessary, he explained, he would ‘go back and live in council house’ in order to stop this iniquitous plot to corrupt the minds of young children.

This is a man whose religion clearly dominates his whole life. Except where it comes to business, that is. Here, the Stagecoach boss’s behaviour is not quite in the spirit of the man who drove the moneylenders out of the temple 2000 years ago. Mr Souter’s business empire was built by driving competitors out of business, slashing wages and sacking workers. But, as the devout transport tycoon explains, ‘If we were to apply the Sermon on the Mount to our business we would be rooked within six months. Don’t misunderstand me, ethics are not irrelevant – but some are incompatible with what we have to do because capitalism is based on greed.’[3](../references/notes.html#chapter-5-3)

Then there’s the chief executive of the German multinational, Continental, which makes tyres. In an interview with Business Week, Hubertus von Grunberg described the anguish he faces every time he has to lay off workers.

‘Our Irish workers were good to us and now they’re no longer with us,’ he says after closing the only tyre factory in Ireland. He goes on, ‘The workers we lost in Austria and East Germany – they were loyal workers. They didn’t stage strikes, they came in on Saturdays when we needed them. They have been good and loyal … they have not caused a recall in 30 years because they made a quality product. And all of a sudden you can’t pay them any more.’[4](../references/notes.html#chapter-5-4)

Reading this interview, it’s hard to fight back the tears of sympathy for this poor creature. So angst-ridden is he at the role he has been forced to play – presumably at gunpoint – that he cannot even bear to use words such as ‘sacked’ or ‘fired’. Instead he talks of the Irish workers being ‘no longer with us’, which gives the impression that they’ve died, and of the Austrian workers being ‘lost’, as though they simply disappeared one morning.

So why exactly are these workers ‘lost’ or ‘no longer with us’? Mr von Grunberg explains: ‘I cannot defend making products [in these countries] with my shareholders. The shareholders will ask me, “well it’s so much better to make products in the Czech Republic and other cheap labour areas. Why don’t you make it all there?” It’s a difficult balancing act, and I would rather not have to do it. It’s not an attractive job.’[5](../references/notes.html#chapter-5-5)

Two years later, and Continental, under Mr von Grunberg, had doubled its profits and its shares were soaring. At the company’s Scottish plant, wages had been slashed by seven per cent and hours increased from 39 to 42. Then, all of a sudden, the Continental bosses decided to make their Scottish workforce ‘disappear’. They announced the closure of their factory on the outskirts of Edinburgh. A thousand Scottish workers were thrown on the dole and production was shifted to Romania, where wage bills are much lower.

The name of the game these days is globalisation. It’s not exactly a new idea. As billionaire currency speculator and business guru George Soros has pointed out, ‘Its main features were first identified in rather prophetic fashion by Karl Marx and Frederick Engels in the Communist Manifesto, published in 1848.’ Soros goes on to make a telling point: ‘Marx and Engels gave a very good analysis of the capitalist system 150 years ago, better in some ways, I may say, than classical economics.’[6](../references/notes.html#chapter-5-6)

From the mid 19th century up until 1914, the global capitalist economy was based on the technology of underwater telegraph cables and steamships. These gigantic scientific advances linked the world together as it had never been linked before. Along with a meteoric explosion in world trade, that period also marked the heyday of military imperialism, when rich, powerful countries such as Britain and the USA marauded across the planet, physically conquering and occupying poorer countries and robbing them of their resources.

The legendary American folk singer Woody Guthrie once sang ‘Some will rob you with a six-gun, others with a fountain pen.’ These days, the weapons of imperialist robbery are more likely to be computers and telephones rather than tanks and battleships and, as a general rule – although there are always exceptions to every rule – the robberies are carried out not by governments, but by giant transnational corporations.

The sheer speed and scale of the interconnections that now link the planet together would have been incomprehensible at the beginning of the last century. These technological changes have smashed down borders and barriers between states and paved the way for the emergence of the new corporate superpowers who shift wealth around the world at the speed of sound.

Globalisation is essentially two simultaneous races. In one of these races, the participants are the giant companies of the world. Their performances are measured by the amount of profits they can pile up. The ultimate goal of each of these companies is to achieve total global domination in their sphere.

The other race involves not corporations but nation-states. But unlike a normal race, which aims to achieve the highest standards possible, this race between nations is a race to achieve the lowest standards possible. You’ll get the general picture if you imagine a football league table where the winners are not the team that achieves the most victories and scores the most goals but the side that suffers the most defeats and concedes the most goals. The nations that can achieve the harshest working conditions, the lowest wages, the most ruthless forms of exploitation, the longest hours, the most threadbare public services, the most polluted environments, are the winners.

While the race involving the global corporations is a race to the top, the other race, involving the national states, is a race to the bottom. Almost every government in the world has filled in its entry form, and there is no more enthusiastic participant in this race than Great Britain. But the UK still has a long way to go before it catches up with the front runners in the race towards national destitution.

A century ago, millions of workers across Central Scotland, the north of Ireland, and northern England toiled their lives away in Dickensian factories which belched poisonous fumes into the atmosphere for semi-starvation wages. These factories have not gone away. They still exist more or less as they did at the time of Dickens, except that they’ve been exported to Jakarta, Bombay, Mexico City, and a hundred other Third World cities, where 80 per cent of the world’s industrial workforce now live. Most of the goods that people use to live their daily lives – clothing, shoes, TVs, watches, toys, jewellery – are now made in these cities of the Southern Hemisphere where wages are low, trade-union rights non-existent, and working conditions akin to the visions of hell described by Alexander Cordell in his novels set in South Wales in the early days of the Industrial Revolution.

In many Bangkok factories, young women from the countryside are conscripted to work 18 hours a day stitching shirts. They are forced to eat and sleep in the factories in which they work. Their drinking water is spiked with amphetamines to make them work harder, faster, and longer.[7](../references/notes.html#chapter-5-7)

In factories across the Ear East, young women are sexually abused as a matter of course. Employees are even locked up in factories to save the companies employing supervisors. In one such factory in Bangkok a few years ago, 200 workers burned to death.

Where the multinationals have moved in, local environments are desecrated beyond recognition. Fertile landscapes are converted into deserts. Rivers, seas, and lakes are turned into toxic reservoirs. Disease runs rampant. But the beauty of globalisation is that it allows the millionaires and billionaires who own the means of production – the factories, the natural resources, the machinery, the computers, the offices – to become even more fabulously wealthy.

The global marketplace is in effect a worldwide market, not for goods, but for cheap labour. It is like a colossal hi-tech international version of the hiring fairs of rural Ireland at the end of the 19th century, as described in the novels and poems of the Donegalborn writer, Patrick McGill, the ‘Navvy Poet’:

> ‘Since two can’t gain in the bargain,  
> Then who shall bear the loss,  
> When little children are auctioned  
> As slaves at the Market Cross?  
> Come to the Cross and the Market,  
> Where the wares of the world are sold,  
> And the wares are little children,  
> Traded for pieces of gold.’[8](../references/notes.html#chapter-5-8)

A BBC2 documentary a few years ago, The Hollow State, looked at how one company, which manufactures polythene bags, closed a factory in the UK and shifted its operation to China. The company now imports the raw polythene into China, turns it into plastic carrier bags, then exports tens of millions of them back to Britain for use in supermarkets. Any transport costs are more than cancelled out by the fact that workers in China are paid £100 a month for a 42-hour week – one tenth of the wages of those who were sacked in Britain.[9](../references/notes.html#chapter-5-9) Across industry as a whole, the same pattern is repeated over and over again. The process began on a modest scale back in the 1970s, with American companies opening factories in the so-called ‘developing countries’ of Latin America and East Asia. Car factories in Brazil were staffed by shanty-town dwellers who could never dream of ever affording to buy any of the cars they built. Most of these cars were exported back to the USA.

But now even the semi-developed countries like Brazil and the Philippines are being spurned by the transnationals as they search for even cheaper labour and even lower rates of taxation. Over the past decade or so, Nike, the American sportswear giant, has flitted from the US to South Korea, to Indonesia and now to Vietnam in a never-ending quest for cheaper labour, lower production costs, and higher profits.

The company’s supply factories employ around 80,000 workers, mainly young women, churning out running shoes for export to the West. Their average wage last year worked out at the equivalent of around £15 a month, which means they would have to save every penny of their wages for five months before they could actually buy a pair of Nike Air running shoes.

Some researchers estimate that, of the £60 you pay in the shops for a pair of running shoes, the 40 workers who produced that shoe in the Far East will have been paid not much more than £1 among them. Even taking into account raw materials and overheads, a running shoe will cost no more than a tenner to produce, which means the sportswear companies and the retailer are making a handsome killing on every pair sold.[10](../references/notes.html#chapter-5-10)

Some corporations have dragged the hunt for cheap labour down to an even lower level. Major American airlines, for example, are now employing prisoners serving life sentences for murder to operate telesales services.[11](../references/notes.html#chapter-5-11)

The insatiable quest by corporate capitalism for higher profits involves more than just a search for the countries that offer the lowest wages, otherwise Rwanda would be the top destination for transnational capitalism. In their battle to attract inward investment, governments also have to offer extra financial inducements, such as grants, concessions, subsidies, and low rates of taxation.

On top of that, big business requires an infrastructure, including roads, railways, airports, ports, water, electricity, and telecommunications. It also looks for a reasonably educated workforce, able to cope with modern industrial techniques, which means at least a basic level of literacy and numeracy.

But neither infrastructure nor education costs are paid for by the transnational corporations. They are provided free of charge by governments, which generate the funds by deducting taxes from the meagre wages that have attracted the multinationals to come in the first place.

At this stage, the flight of industry to the Southern Hemisphere has mainly involved traditional manufacturing industries. But increasingly, hi-tech companies too are looking southwards. In India, some computer programmers earn as little £2000 a year, or £40 a week.[12](../references/notes.html#chapter-5-12) Economists calculate that within a generation there will be millions of trained engineers, scientists, computer programmers, software writers, data analysts, and other professional experts prepared to work for a fraction of the wages of the workforces of Europe and America.

In addition, the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe can offer a highly educated workforce prepared to work for rock-bottom rates of pay, an alluring combination for the corporate vultures. As these Eastern European states sign up for the European Union, the writing will begin to appear on the wall of the hundreds of electronics factories across Central Scotland that make up Silicon Glen. American and Asian investment in these plants (and in similar plants in South Wales and southern Ireland) has been motivated, in part at least, by the need to gain access to the lucrative European Union marketplace.

As technology advances, the balance of power shifts even more decisively in favour of the giant transnational corporations. For example, Ford UK, the British arm of the American car multinational, has recently announced that it will buy its components online, rather than from local supply industries. In practice, it will mean that the company can trawl the Internet searching for the cheapest suppliers of the hundreds of different parts that are required to assemble a car.

In the past, car factories and other assembly plants stimulated entire regional economies. The shipbuilding industry on the Clyde, essentially an assembly industry, generated five jobs outside the yard for every worker employed in the actual construction of a ship. In its heyday, shipbuilding employed upwards of 100,000 people – but hundreds of thousands more were employed in local engineering factories which supplied the yards. Now companies like Ford can buy in, for instance, windscreens from China, upholstery from Indonesia, brake discs from the Philippines, and so on. Meanwhile, local supply industries topple like skittles.

Some right-wing economists, mesmerised by statistics showing profits surging, stock markets booming, and technology advancing fantasise that we are living a ‘New Economy’, in which all the old problems of recessions and slumps, unemployment and inflation, strikes and political discontent, have become as outdated as cloth caps and tacket boots

Professor Donald MacKay, the former chief of Scottish Enterprise, claims that ‘the effects of globalisation, spread about with the aid of the advanced countries, will address world poverty’.[13](../references/notes.html#chapter-5-13)

Unfortunately for the billions who actually suffer poverty, the eminent professor is living in Disneyland. The truth is that, far from exporting prosperity to the Third World, globalisation is importing Third World poverty into the First World.

The ships that were once built on the Clyde are now built by cheap labour on the Yangtse, while once-thriving shipbuilding communities are turned into post-industrial wastelands. The textile mills in the Borders fall silent and empty, their work taken over by industrial concentration camps in Jakarta and Manila. From Clydebank to Selkirk and scores of towns in between, the price of globalisation is mass long-term unemployment.

So far, the full brutal consequences of globalisation have been partly masked by the economic upswing of the past eight years, which has generated millions of low-paid service jobs across the Northern Hemisphere. But, as author John Katz, an investment expert who edits Portfolio 2000, points out, ‘What goes up must come down’. Katz goes on to predict ‘a nosebleed-inducing dive and a very hard landing indeed’.

Similarly, the influential American Business Week magazine warns that ‘sooner, rather than later, the new economy boom is likely to be followed by a new economy bust – a recession and stockmarket decline which could be much deeper than most people expect’.[14](../references/notes.html#chapter-5-14)

The reason for this ‘business cycle’ of upswing-downswing, recovery-recession, boom-bust, was laid bare more than a century ago by Karl Marx. In a system based on the exploitation of labour for private profit, the workforce cannot be paid enough to buy the goods they produce, otherwise there would be no profit for the shareholders.

On a global scale, more goods are made than the population of the world can afford. Every so often, vast surpluses pile up which cannot be sold for profit. As a result, the stock market plummets, profits turn into losses, businesses fail, factories close, workers are sacked, unemployment grows, and, for a period of time, there is a general contraction of industry and trade.

That’s exactly what happened a few years ago to the Asian Tigers of the Far East. One day economists and politicians across the globe, including Tony Blair, were drooling over ‘the Asian economic miracle’. Then all of sudden the wine turned back into water. The entire region was dragged into recession and the subsequent social turmoil ended the 32-year reign of President Suharto of Indonesia.

In America and Europe, recession has been staved off temporarily by new technology and globalisation, in much the same way that a hangover can be delayed by drinking another bottle of wine. But eventually everything catches up, and the economic hangover that will follow the current consumer binge is likely be to severe indeed.

If anything the new globalised economy based on super-profiteering and ultra-exploitation is even more fragile and unstable than traditional capitalism. Back in the days when Henry Ford launched his T-model Ford, his assembly workers were paid $750 a year. It would have taken two years’ wages for these American workers to buy a Ford car. Today, many Latin American and Asian car assembly workers are paid around $1000, and would have to work for 15 years to buy one of the cars they make.

In every sector of the global economy, the same gulf exists between wages and prices. In the sportswear industry, for example, there are an estimated one billion pairs of unsold training shoes, or one for every six people in the world.

Eventually, the billions of products being churned out daily in factories and assembly plants across the world will saturate the world markets, leading to a new downward spiral. No-one can predict the exact day, week, month, or even year when this will occur. Nor can we anticipate how long a new recession will last, or how steep it will be, or the political repercussions that will flow from it. But one thing is certain: when this orgy of profiteering turns sour, it won’t be the profiteers who caused the crisis who will pay the price for that crisis.
