IN HIS BOOK *Who Owns Scotland* Andy Wightman relates the story of a Fife miner walking home one evening, carrying some illegally poached pheasants. Suddenly, the local landowner appears at his side and demands he hand over the pheasants.

> 'Don’t you know that this is my land and these are my pheasants?' brays the landowner.  
> 'And where did you get it?' asks the miner.  
> 'I inherited it from my father!' replies the landowner.  
> 'So where did he get it?'  
> 'From his father. This land has belonged to my family for 500 years.'  
> 'And where did they get it from 500 years ago?'  
> 'They fought for it.'  
> 'Well, then,’ says the miner. ‘Take off your jacket and I’ll fight you for it!'1

In Our Scots Noble Families, published back in 1909, Forward editor, Tom Johnston, lambasted the Scottish aristocracy. ‘Our Nobility is not noble. Its lands are stolen lands – stolen either by force or fraud … the title deeds are rapine, murder, massacre, cheating or Court harlotry.’2

The old Scottish aristocracy has been partly squeezed out by a new breed of absentee landowners. Almost as much Scottish land is now held by overseas landowners as is held by the traditional aristocracy. Nonetheless, many of the same noble families that Johnston pilloried at the beginning of last century continue to own vast expanses of rural Scotland. This self-perpetuating elite includes the Duke of Buccleuch, the Earl of Seafield, the Duke of Sutherland, the clan chieftain, Captain Alwyn Farqhuarson, and the Duke of Roxburghe. The 280,000 acres owned by the Duke of Buccleuch stretch all the way from the Firth of Forth to the Solway Firth.

Not so long ago, the 29th Chieftain of the MacLeod clan, John MacLeod of MacLeod decided to fix his leaky roof. Most people would have flicked through the Yellow Pages and called in the builders. If necessary, they’d maybe take out a bank loan to pay the bill. But, when you live in Dunvegan Castle, more grandiose measures are called for. The owner of the majestic fortress decided he needed £10 million to fix his roof, so he tried to put the entire Cuillin mountain range up for sale.

The Cuillin is one of the most dramatic landscapes in Northern Europe, a mountain wilderness covering 25 square miles of southern Skye. If someone tried to sell you the North Pole, or Mount Everest, or the Grand Canyon, you’d probably take pity on them. But in 21st-century Scotland, these types of transaction take place all the time. It’s as though the last five centuries had never happened.

If anything, as time goes on, landownership in Scotland has become even more grotesquely concentrated in fewer and fewer hands. In no other country in Europe, nor even in Latin America, with its notorious economic disparities, is there such an unequal distribution of land.

According to Wightman’s brilliantly researched book, 16 million of Scotland’s 19 million acres of land are privately owned. Two thirds of this land is owned by 1252 landowners. Or, to put it another way, 0.025 per cent of the population owns 66 per cent of Scotland.3

Not just in Europe, but throughout most of the world, there are restrictions on landownership. In most of Europe, no-one is allowed to buy land unless they intend to spend most of the year actually living on it. They also require to register their possession of land and have to submit to stringent regulations and conditions.

But not in Scotland. Here anyone can buy land. Then they can do what they want with that land. They can increase the rents for the tenants and small farmers who live on the land. They can leave it to rack and ruin. They can break it up into smaller packages and flog these off to stalking, shooting, and angling companies who then turn the land into playgrounds for the rich. They can erect signposts, as one landowner around Loch Cluny did, announcing that ‘This mountain is closed.’

And they have immense power over the lives of the communities who live on their land. Lord Vestey, the meat-industry tycoon who owns the 100,000-acre Assynt estate has been described as ‘the richest man in the Highlands’. This would be an accurate description if he actually lived in the Highlands. In fact, he lives in Suffolk and works in London.

Yet according to local people in Assynt, Vestey has stopped a swimming pool being built in an area that has a desperate lack of amenities, prevented a new housing development in a community with a dire housing shortage, and thwarted plans to establish a factory unit in a part of the Highlands that is being steadily depopulated because of lack of work.4

Before the people of Eigg took over ownership of the island, it had been owned by a Yorkshire millionaire, Keith Schellenberg, who denounced the entire population of the island as ‘hippies and hooligans’. He then sold it on to a German painter, Marlin Maruma, who decided on a whim to buy the island, then visited it exactly twice in two years.

Few other countries in the world would allow vast tracts of land to be sold off to wealthy individuals for the purpose of indulging in an extravagant hobby. Yet, in Scotland, there are now 800 huge sporting estates, according to the British Association for Shooting and Conservation. These estates cost hundreds of thousands of pounds each to run.

The landowners claim that these estates create jobs. Yet as Auslan Cramb points out in his book Who Owns Scotland Now?, there are estates in the Highlands of 50,000 acres and more which employ just a handful of people on bare subsistence wages. The fact is, far more jobs could be created if these sporting estates were taken into public and community ownership and run democratically, in the interests of the local population.

There are reputedly some good landowners who co-operate with local communities and are conscious of the need to protect the environment. No doubt, in the Middle Ages, some feudal barons were more humanitarian than others in their treatment of the vassals they owned. Even some slave owners occasionally treated their slaves almost as generously as they treated their pets. But why, in the 21st century, should rural communities be forced to cross their fingers collectively and hope that the next wealthy landowner who comes along will be a benevolent paternalistic laird rather than a tinpot tyrant?

As Dutch land specialist, Jan van de Ploeg, from the Agricultural University at Wageningen, observed on the BBC TV programme, Eorpa, ‘It is very curious how people treat land in Scotland. Land is simply a commodity. This is wild west capitalism. One of the most valuable assets for the future, the land, can be bought and sold at will. Elsewhere in Europe that is not the case. It makes Scotland a truly unique case.’5

There have been a few mild land reforms introduced by the Scottish Parliament since then, but the words of van de Ploeg are still 100 per cent relevant. Communities are now allowed to purchase land, but first they have to wait, perhaps for generations, before the land comes onto the market. Then they have to raise colossal sums of money to buy the land, not an easy feat for the average sparsely populated and impoverished community in an area like the West Highlands.

In Who Owns Scotland Now?, Auslan Cramb expresses some sympathy for the aristocratic Sutherland clan dynasty, who are still ostracised for the cold cruelty displayed by their ancestors during the Highland Clearances. ‘The atrocities of Nazi Germany, much more recently, are not visited on decent Germans today,’ protests Cramb.

But ‘decent Germans today’ did not inherit ownership of Germany from their Nazi ancestors. The Scottish aristocracy want to have their cake and eat it. They complain when they are snubbed from officiating at the Gaelic Mod because their ancestors set out to liquidate Gaelic culture. Yet they simultaneously claim a divine right to ownership of vast lands because they happen to have been born into the right family.

The priests in Latin America who preach Liberation Theology denounce private landownership as immoral. Their philosophy is simple: the land was created by God, therefore no human being has a right to claim personal ownership of that land. It is not necessary to subscribe to any religious belief to be in broad sympathy with that philosophy.

In a future socialist Scotland, the land will be legally recognised as the common property of the Scottish people. That doesn’t mean that the state would seize people’s houses and gardens, or collectivise small and medium-sized farms.

It does mean bringing sporting estates and other unoccupied land into social or community ownership under democratic local management. It does mean imposing upper limits on landholdings, which would vary depending on the quality and use of land. It does mean giving local communities the opportunity to leasehold land on a co-operative or communal basis and run the land themselves.

And it does mean dragging Scotland out of the 18th century and into the 21st century by ending the system that allows individuals to own vast empires of mountains and lochs, farms and crofts, towns and villages, all because of the blood that flows through their veins, or the cash that flows through their bank accounts.

Scotland may not be classified a Third World country, but like most of Africa, Asia, and Latin America, our natural resources are greedily grabbed up by whatever rich individual or powerful company comes along and writes a cheque. Only the rain that falls from the skies is still owned by the people of Scotland, and that’s only because the people of Scotland refused to allow the last Tory government to sell it to the City spivs.

Unfortunately, the oil that lies underneath the North Sea has already been sold off, or, to be more precise, it has been given away. According to the SNP, ‘It’s Scotland’s Oil.’ New Labour say, ‘No, it’s Britain’s oil.’ As is usually the case, both sets of politicians are wrong. Britain doesn’t own North Sea oil. Nor would Scotland own North Sea oil, even if the SNP were to take power in an independent Scotland.

The truth is, North Sea oil is owned, lock, stock, and barrel, by a collection of transnational oil companies. Not that these companies actually created the oil, any more than the feudal barons and clan chieftains created the land that their descendants now own. Nor did the oil companies even discover the oil in the first place.

It was first discovered in 1962 by the British government, who set out looking for gas and accidentally discovered black gold buried deep beneath the North Sea. By 1964, Whitehall had handed out 100,000 square miles of sea-bed to multinational oil companies for exploration. Since the oil began to flow in 1969, these companies have made hundreds of billions of pounds of profit for their shareholders. Scotland has received a fraction of that money.

In March 2000 oil revenues were running at almost £45 million a day, according to the Royal Bank of Scotland. Of that cash, around £13 million went to the British exchequer in corporation tax. Around £1.3 million of that was directed back to Scotland, as our share of UK revenues. Meanwhile, the oil companies grabbed over £30 million a day. In other words, every day, a few thousand North Sea oil-company shareholders receive 25 times more than the whole of Scotland with its five million inhabitants.6

In most other oil-producing countries in the world, such a state of affairs would be incomprehensible. In Malaysia, Brazil, Mexico, Venezuela, South Korea, and across the Middle East, oil is publicly owned. Some of these national governments have come under pressure from the International Monetary Fund to privatise the industry in order to raise instant cash to pay off national debts. Invariably, this has provoked the type of public backlash that the British Tory government faced when it tried to privatise Scottish water.

In a country like Mexico, the publicly owned oil company Pemex generates up to 40 per cent of all government revenues. In Norway, where the industry is now under threat of privatisation from a right-wing government, the largest oil company is fully publicly owned, while the two other oil companies are part publicly owned. As a result, the Norwegian government has been awash with money and has been able to carry out extensive social and welfare programmes.

In 1974, Britain elected a Labour government led by Harold Wilson, which promised to nationalise North Sea oil. In power, Wilson decided the policy was ‘impractical’. But it wasn’t impractical in Malaysia, which in 1974 took over the country’s oilfields. Nor was it impractical in Venezuela, which followed suit two years later. Today, the publicly owned Malaysian oil corporation, Petronas, is included in the Fortune 500 largest companies in the world; while the state-owned Petreolos de Venezuela is now the third biggest exporter of crude oil in the world.

The attitude of successive British governments was lampooned a quarter of a century ago in John McGrath’s ground-breaking play, The Cheviot, the Stag, and the Black, Black Oil, performed by the newly formed 7:84 Theatre Company. In one scene, an American oil tycoon performs a frenzied barn dance, singing

> ‘Take your oil-rigs by the score,  
> Drill a little well just a little off-shore,  
> Pipe that oil in from the sea,  
> Pipe those profits – home to me.’

He then tells the audience: ‘Your wonderful Labourite government was real nice: thank God they weren’t socialists.’

The ‘Labourite’ governments of the 1960s and 1970s certainly were not socialists. But today’s ‘Labourite government’ is truly beyond satire. While Harold Wilson occasionally issued threats – albeit empty threats – of nationalisation to the oil companies, Tony Blair is flown out by BP to inaugurate the opening of the new Andrew Field, on which trade unions are to be refused recognition. He then goes on to appoint the BP chief executive, Lord Simon, to the post of Minister of Trade in the New Labour government.

One of Blair’s Scottish allies, Martin O’Neill MP, calls for longer shifts for oil workers and for oil companies to be exempted from the European Union Social Chapter. Another, the ex-Shadow Secretary of State, George Robertson, now head of NATO, solemnly assured a gathering of oil bosses that Labour wanted ‘to reduce costs for the oil companies’; in other words, to increase the profits of the oil moguls at the expense of wages and safety conditions.7

It is a bizarre fact that in the 30 years since North Sea oil began to flow ashore, the Shetland Islands council has put up more resistance to the oil transnationals than the entire procession of Labour-Tory-Labour-Tory-Labour governments combined. Shetland imposed a local tax of 15 pence on every barrel passing through and insisted on a guaranteed annual payment of at least £750,000 for local services. In a rather bizarre outburst, the man who in the 1970s was the United States consul in Scotland, representing the world’s mightiest superpower in the 1970s, later described tiny Shetland as ‘the tyrant that bestrode oil’.8

While the savage Shetlanders tyrannised the poor defenceless oil companies, successive British governments were far more reasonable. They abolished petroleum revenue tax. They refused to take royalties. They slashed corporation tax to just 30 per cent, the lowest rate by far of any major country in Europe. They allowed the oil giants to ban trade unions. They let the oil companies away with murder – literally, claim some of the relatives of the 167 workers killed in the Piper Alpha explosion in 1988.

Like the Tories before them, the New Labour government believes that nothing must be allowed to stand in the way of free enterprise. Unfortunately, the SNP has an even more subservient attitude. They want to cut corporation tax even further, possibly to less than half of its current level.

Most mainstream politicians these days have resigned themselves to market forces. ‘We live in a global economy,’ they say. ‘And in a global economy you can’t buck market forces.’ Nor can you bring industries into social ownership, because that’s against the rules of global capitalism. That would be piracy. And, in any case, we haven’t got the expertise to run an industry as complex as the oil industry. And, by the way, don’t you realise that big business can simply pull out and relocate to the other side of the world these days if it doesn’t like what you’re doing?

All these arguments can be distilled down to a single word: baloney. If a whole series of countries managed to take over and successfully run their own oil industry back in the 1970s, how come we don’t have the expertise today, when Aberdeen is the oil capital of Europe and Scotland has been producing oil for over 30 years?

And how is it possible to relocate an oilfield anyway? The Internet may be a powerful new tool, but no-one has yet developed the technology that can spirit away 100 oilfields to the other side of the world via modems and broad-band cables.

New Labour and the Tories repeatedly insist that an independent Scotland would be uneconomic, that it would have a deficit of billions. But an independent Scotland that owned and controlled the revenues flooding in from North Sea oil would have a surplus of anything between £10 billion to £15 billion a year, depending upon fluctuations in world oil prices.

It would allow for the greatest expansion of public services that this country has ever seen. And it would also generate the resources to allow an independent socialist Scotland to face up to one of the biggest challenges of the 21st century, the building of a brand-new energy industry based on alternative, renewable sources of power.

The Cheviot, the Stag, and the Black, Black Oil ended with a Gaelic song written in the 1890s by Mary MacPherson, whose family was driven from the Isle of Skye during the Highland Clearances. In English, the song says:

> ‘Remember your hardships and keep up your struggle,  
> The wheel will turn for you,  
> By the strength of your hands and hardness of your fists.  
> Your cattle will be on the plains,  
> Everyone in the land will have a place,  
> And the exploiter will be driven out.’

The exploiter still has not been driven out. Back in the days when he was a socialist, Gordon Brown condemned the SNP for their acceptance of the private ownership of land, oil, and other industries, and for their rejection of class politics: ‘The SNP’s “new politics”, which rejects “class warfare”, presumes the familiar priorities of wealth and power over people … Their rejection of public ownership of land, oil, and the basic industries … assumes the subservience of Scottish workers to private international controls.’9

Now, as Chancellor of the Exchequer, the same Gordon Brown resists pressure for a paltry penny-in-the-pound increase in corporation tax for the oil companies, even though, as the Petroleum Economist magazine notes approvingly, ‘The UK’s tax system for oil and gas ventures is the most attractive of any established producing country worldwide.’10

The Gordon Brown who sits in Downing Street today may have grown 25 years older, and 25 times richer, sleeker, and more conservative, but the exploiters are still exploiting Scotland’s natural resources for private greed. Eventually, as Mary MacPherson said, they will be driven out.
