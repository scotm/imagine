IT’S THE FINAL Christmas of the 20th century, and across the world, people are preparing to celebrate the dawn of a new millennium.

In a small town in Central Scotland, an elderly couple shiver in the cold and dark. Mary has left her pension book in a neighbour’s home but, like many women of her generation, is too proud to ask for help. She’s managed to scrape together £5 to buy a power card, but because the couple have used up their £14 emergency credit, it’s not enough to restore the electricity supply.

A few days later, the body of her husband, Willie, is removed from their home. A retired miner who has spent most of his working life toiling away underground to provide society with heat and light, Willie has frozen to death.1

While he lies lifeless in his bed, Strathclyde Police are holding a press conference 30 miles away to announce the 146th drugs-related death in the region since the start of the year. If that number of young people perished in a plane crash or a fire in a nightclub, the whole nation would have been in mourning for weeks on end. But most of these young people are heroin addicts, mainlining the drug into their veins in the back streets of some of Europe’s bleakest, most impoverished housing estates. The director of the government-sponsored drugs campaign, Scotland Against Drugs, tells the press conference, ‘One thing that strikes you when you speak to many young drug users is that people often don’t care whether they live or die.’2

These two incidents span a 50-year generation gap. At one end are thousands of men and women who have spent their lives toiling away in pits, factories, docks, and shipyards, who have raised families, who have fought in wars. Now they live out their final days scraping together enough cash for a power card to heat their homes.

At the other end are thousands of young people who have never worked because they were born at the wrong time, in the wrong housing scheme, in the wrong city. They have no present and no future, so they destroy their bodies and brains with lethal concoctions supplied by criminal drugs gangs.

Scotland is by no stretch of the imagination a Third World country. The land where pensioners freeze to death in their homes is a land teeming with natural and man-made energy, including oil, gas, electricity, coal, hydro and nuclear power. The city where young people die on the streets every couple of days is a 50-minute train journey from one of the richest financial centres in Europe, whose banks control funds worth £300 billion, or £60,000 for every man, woman, and child in Scotland.3

A generation ago, Gunther Stent, the pioneer of microbiology, wrote a book which was hailed as a visionary insight into the bright brand-new world that lay ahead. Published in 1969, The Coming of the Golden Age: A View of the End of Progress antici- pated the end of poverty, starvation, disease and war.4

Within a generation or so, according to Stent, science would solve all of the pressing problems of society. Gradually, the Third World would prosper, eventually catching up with Europe and North America. Meanwhile social inequality within the more advanced countries would diminish as living standards were ‘levelled up’. Worldwide economic progress would in turn reduce national and ethnic antagonisms, consigning warfare to the toxic waste dump of history. Even pollution would be eradicated as new techniques were developed for harnessing energy.

By all the laws of logic, Stent’s predictions should have been fulfilled by now. Back in 1969, when The Golden Age was published, the technical means and the resources already existed to feed, clothe and house every human being comfortably. Since then, technological progress has accelerated at a dizzying pace. We can send spaceships to the far-flung reaches of our solar system to photograph distant planets. Microcomputers that can fit into the palm of the hand can transmit whole libraries of information instantaneously across the globe. We have learned to perform medical miracles, including heart, lung, and liver transplants. We have begun to unravel the mysteries of human DNA, and even to clone animals.

Yet, to paraphrase the French proverb, the more things have changed, the more they have remained the same. Poverty, starvation, disease, pollution, racism, and war continue to stalk the planet. If anything, whole tracts of the Third World are even more impoverished today than they were 30 years ago.

Back in 1973, the President of the World Bank, Robert McNamara, addressed the annual conference of that organisation and declared, ‘We should strive to eradicate poverty by end of the century.’5

Today the World Bank confesses that 1.2 billion live in ‘extreme poverty’, with a total income of less than 66 pence a day. It calculates that three billion people – half the world’s population – survives on less than £1 a day. The organisation also admits that the poorest 63 countries, containing 57 per cent of the earth’s population, receive just six per cent of all income.6

And the gap between rich and poor is growing wider every day, both within countries and between countries. A United Nations report published at the start of the 21st century makes the point that global inequalities increased in the course of the 20th century by ‘a magnitude out of proportion to anything ever experienced before’. The lifespan in the poorest African countries is now half that of the richest countries. The report explains that, in 1820, the gap between the richest and poorest countries was three to one. By 1950 it had risen to 35 to one. Today it is 74 to one.7

Back in 1984, the Ethiopian famine aroused the sympathy of the whole planet. Huge charity extravaganzas, including Band Aid, were staged to help alleviate the suffering. The spotlight was turned full glare on Third World starvation and governments across the world came under pressure to ensure such a calamity could never again occur.

More than 15 years later, the charity Christian Aid estimates that in the continent of Africa a child dies prematurely every five seconds. Some starve to death because their families are too poor to buy food. Others die of ‘preventable’ diseases, because their governments cannot afford to buy medicines.

In this glittering new hi-tech global economy of the 21st century, one in three children in the world are malnourished. Another 250 million child labourers under the age of 14 toil away in Third World factories and farms. Millions more are sold into slavery or prostitution. Others have their limbs amputated to attract more money when they are sent out to beg on the streets. Many have their organs removed and sold for transplants.

As this social catastrophe spreads and multiplies, charities battle on in a valiant attempt to relieve the suffering. Every year, high-profile events such as Comic Relief bring scenes of total destitution to our TV screens. In 1999, the event announced a record-breaking £27.4 million raised, which is a tribute to the generosity of ordinary people the length and breadth of the UK. But, compared to the real wealth that is swilling around the planet, £27 million is like a grain of sand in the desert. Every single day, 25,000 times that sum – £750 billion – is gambled away on the world’s stock exchanges and currency markets.8

In contrast to the mass destitution that blights the southern hemisphere, the prosperous north produces and consumes more material wealth than ever before. Fifteen per cent of the world’s population – mainly in Europe, North America, and Japan – receives nearly 80 per cent of the planet’s income, according to the World Bank.9 Millions of families now have access to cars, TVs, telephones, videos, central heating, microwave ovens, fridge-freezers and dishwashers. We live in an affluent society. In the words of George Kerevan, the guru of the Thatcherite wing of Scottish nationalism, ‘These days we all shop at Gap and drink designer beer.’10 At least, that’s what we’re told. But is it true?

It is certainly true that there are plenty of people who buy fashionable clothes and relax at the weekend over a couple of beers. But, then again, most of these people work long hours and produce fat profits for their employers. There are also plenty of people who buy their clothes at Poundstretchers or What Everyone Wants rather than Gap. And there are others, usually seen huddled in shop doorways in our city centres, who don’t shop anywhere, drink anywhere or, for that matter, live anywhere.

At the same time, there are people who will cheerfully pay £2000 for a bottle of wine in Edinburgh’s more exclusive restaurants – a year’s income for an unemployed single person – and others who will splash out ten times that sum on a new party dress.

It’s true that there are less mega-rich people in Scotland than there are in Los Angeles or London. It’s also true that far fewer people in Scotland are destitute than in Lima or Lagos. But, far from being a classless nation, modern-day Caledonia is a grotesquely divided society where elements of Beverly Hills meet elements of the Third World.

An exaggeration? Not according to the Malnutrition Advisory Group. In early 2000, the organisation produced a shock report revealing that half of all patients admitted to hospital in Scotland’s biggest city, Glasgow, are suffering from malnutrition. The advisory group estimates that 65,000 people in the city, one in ten of the total population, are so undernourished that they are vulnerable to disease.11

Other surveys have shown that 43 per cent of pupils attending primary and secondary schools in the city receive free school meals, while 58 per cent are eligible for clothing and footwear grants because their parents cannot afford to buy these items.12

At a seminar for Members of the Scottish Parliament in August 1999, social policy expert Professor David Donnison produced figures showing that, across Scotland as a whole, 25 per cent of the population – 1.2 million people – live in households which are officially designated as poor. Most of these households include young children: 34 per cent of all Scottish children, and 41 per cent of under-fives, live on or below the poverty line. ‘People do not recognise the gravity of the crisis we face,’ Professor Donnison told the seminar.

Some people would like to pretend that poverty does not exist in this country: ‘But these people are not really poor. They live in the lap of luxury compared to the starving millions in Africa. Real poverty might have existed in Britain in the 1930s, but not nowadays.’

Usually the people who make such claims live in nice suburban homes, send their children to expensive private schools, and have small fortunes – or sometimes even large fortunes – stashed away in stocks, shares, and investment accounts.

No-one would seriously claim that poverty in Glasgow or Liverpool today is directly comparable with starvation in Ethiopia or Mozambique. But poverty is not a straightforward financial equation.

A few years ago, community worker Mari Marcel Thekaekara came to Scotland from India with her husband. Their intention was to reverse the stereotype of an aid worker from a wealthy country travelling to the other side of the world to help the poor.

She described her experiences to the New Internationalist magazine: ‘We were told that the Easterhouse housing estate in Glasgow was considered Europe’s worst slum. We thought this was ludicrous. These people had assured housing, electricity, hot and cold water, refrigerators, and cookers. By Indian standards this was middle-class luxury.

‘But then it hit us. Most of the men in Easterhouse hadn’t had a job in 20 years. They were dispirited and depressed, often alcoholic. Emotionally and mentally, they were far worse off than the poor where we lived, even though the physical trappings of poverty were less stark.

‘The Easterhouse men who’d been jobless for 20 years felt far more hopeless than people in India who scrabbled in garbage heaps to feed their kids, though both groups were at the bottom of society.’13

Many older people who grew up during the Great Depression of the 1930s will claim that ‘we were poor, but we were happy’. Of course, people’s memories can play tricks with the passage of time. Often, it’s the good experiences that you remember and the bad experiences that you repress.

People weren’t exactly dancing in the streets when unemployment in Glasgow reached 50 per cent in the mid-1930s. Instead there was an outpouring of rage, expressed in hunger marches and in the growth of radical political parties.

Across Europe, fascism, which fed on mass unemployment and destitution, came from nowhere to conquer power in one country after another. At the opposite end of the political spectrum, communist parties and other left-wing organisations mushroomed into mass movements.

Yet there is more than a grain of truth in the rose-tinted reminiscences of some older people as they recall the sense of community and solidarity that made life more tolerable even in the darkest days of the Hungry Thirties.

In those days, everyone was in the same boat. Material deprivation was accepted as a normal part of working-class existence. The communitarian culture and extended families of the tenements and pit villages provided a rudimentary form of local socialism in which everyone looked out for everyone else.

That is not to romanticise the past. People nowadays have greater freedom to choose where they live, how they live, and who they live with. There is greater tolerance of diversity. But, as the old structures and institutions break down, people are becoming more isolated, more pessimistic, more fearful of the future, more ground down by the stresses and strains of everyday life. A recent survey by the Lloyds TSB Life Index found that in Scotland only 41 per cent of the population are optimistic about the future. According to the Royal Society of Medicine, depression has reached epidemic proportions worldwide and costs the UK economy £2 billion a year.14

Day in, day out, we are bombarded with images of glamour, wealth, and success. Back in the mid-1960s Mick Jagger lampooned the advertising industry in the classic Rolling Stones song, ‘Satisfaction’.

> ‘And that man comes on to tell me  
> just how white my shirts should be.  
> But he can’t be a man ’cos he doesn’t  
> smoke the same cigarettes as me.’

Yet, back then, advertising was a gentle amateur affair compared with the manic multi-billion-pound marketing industry of the 21st century. Huge psychological pressures bear down, especially on those at the bottom of society, to wear the right clothes, drink the right beer, drive the right car, sport the right trainers, wear the right perfume or aftershave, buy the right toys for their children.

But as everyone knows, outward appearances can be deceptive. Many of the same people who sport designer labels live in dilapidated housing, exist on poor diets, suffer ill health – and are up to their ears in debt.

Poverty is not just a matter of inconvenience to those who suffer it; it’s a matter of life and death. On average, a male Glaswegian will die six years younger than the average Englishman. A female Glaswegian will die five years younger than her English counterpart. Glaswegians in general are twice as likely to die before the age of 65 than their affluent neighbours just across the city boundary in Bearsden.15

At the start of a new century, despair weighs down like a gravestone in the hearts of hundreds of thousands of Scots. In an eloquent expression of this sense of hopelessness, a tenants’ leader in Glasgow’s run-down Possil housing scheme told the Scottish Socialist Voice, ‘The flats here are damp, the curtains meet in the middle of the room because of the draughts, and every second kid has an asthma inhaler. This is the Third World. Some people call it Bangladesh.’16
