BACK IN THE 19th century, the Scottish historian Thomas Carlyle stated, ‘History is the biography of great men.’ Many of us remember being taught in school the story of Robert the Bruce and the spider. Or the story of Mary Queen of Scots who ended up getting her head chopped off. Or the story of Bonnie Prince Charlie arriving on a boat in the West Highlands to proclaim the Jacobite Rebellion.

These are certainly colourful tales. Stories of the exploits of heroic individuals such as William Wallace, or the legendary Clydeside revolutionary socialist John Maclean, undoubtedly help to bring history to life.

But the history lessons, the historical novels, and the Hollywood blockbusters invariably fail to recognise the role that ordinary people play in shaping events. History is not made primarily by charismatic individuals, it is made by the masses.

The history of the past two centuries is an epic story of exploitation, injustice, war, greed, and treachery. But it is also a heroic tale of resistance, defiance, solidarity, selflessness, and sacrifice by millions of ordinary people.

Here in Scotland, key landmarks in the past 200 years of struggle have included the 1820 weavers’ insurrection; the Chartist uprising; the Highland Land League battles against the tyranny of the landlords; the Glasgow rent strikes of 1915; the campaign of the Suffragettes; the workers’ revolt that earned the West of Scotland the nickname ‘Red Clydeside’; the ‘People’s Republic of Fife’, when miners took control of their pit villages during the 1926 General Strike; the giant protest marches and the decades of direct action against nuclear weapons; the UCS work-in; the year-long miners’ strike of 1984–85; the Poll Tax mass non-payment campaign which led to the toppling of Thatcher; and the defeat of the Tory plans to privatise Scottish water.

There have also been countless, more localised, workplace, community, and environmental struggles against exploitation and injustice. In recent years, these have included occupations of closure-threatened schools and community centres in Glasgow; occupations of factories such as Caterpillar in Lanarkshire and Glacier Metal in Glasgow; illegal defiance demos in Glasgow and Edinburgh against the Tory Criminal Justice Act; and environmental battles against motorway construction projects, genetically-modified crops, toxic-waste dumps, nuclear weapons, nuclear dumping, and opencast mines.

Some of these struggles were successful; others were lost. But all of them, individually and combined, had a profound impact on those who participated in them and upon society as a whole. Without these battles against injustice, life today would be more primitive, more barren, more oppressive.

But what has all this to do with socialism? After all, these weren’t really movements to change society; they were movements to improve society, to reform society.

It has plenty to with to socialism for two reasons. First, because this never-ending treadmill of conflict can only be halted by the creation of a new society. The heroism, the energy, the talent that has been devoured by struggle over the ages could have and should have been channelled more creatively. But capitalism by its nature forces people to fight ferociously for the most meagre reforms. Like Sisyphus, the character in Greek mythology who had to keep rolling the stone up to the top of the hill, working-class people have had to keep battling, generation after generation, sometimes even just to stand still.

Secondly, because whenever people take action against their employer, or against the government, or against a private company that is desecrating their local environment, they get a taste of their own power.

We are brought up in a culture of deference. Politics is not for ordinary people, but for an educated elite. Yes, you’re allowed to trudge out to the polling station every few years to send some middle-class pin-striped social climber to Westminster or Holyrood. But in between times you’re expected to entertain yourself with soap operas, football, and pop music, while the politicians get on with the important business of making sure that the rich keep on getting richer.

Whenever people participate in acts of resistance, they begin to change. They begin to see things more clearly. They begin to understand more thoroughly how society works. They begin to feel more confident about themselves and less confident in the politicians and businessmen. They begin to question all the old prejudices, all the old attitudes, all the old certainties that they’ve always accepted as gospel. In other words, the seeds of socialism are sown in struggle.

Before the Poll Tax was introduced, people had begun to believe that the then Tory Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, was invincible. She had seen off the miners, the railworkers, the printworkers, the nurses. It seemed to some people that nothing, but nothing, could be done to stop her. That was the unspoken belief that paralysed the trade union and labour movement in the 1980s.

The Labour leader at the time, Neil Kinnock, condemned those organising against the Poll Tax in the most venomous language. They were, he said, ‘Toytown revolutionaries who pretend the tax can be stopped and the government toppled by mass non-payment.’1 Within a year of Kinnock’s outburst, the tax was stopped, and the head of the government was toppled, by mass non-payment.

The defeat of the Poll Tax did not just remove a hated tax which blatantly discriminated against the poor. It also changed people’s attitudes towards the law and those who administer it. Particularly in working-class areas, the culture of deference to authority was torn down and has never been re-established.

As the song says, ‘Freedom’s just another word for nothing left to lose.’ The battle for socialism won’t be spearheaded by prosperous politicians or middle-class intellectuals but by those who have nothing to lose and everything to gain from the defeat of capitalism. Working-class women, especially, will be in the front line.

Socialism is not an exclusive club. The building of a new society can never be achieved by a minority, no matter how far-sighted, heroic or self-sacrificing that minority is. Socialism won’t be achieved by a coup or a conspiracy. It won’t be achieved by a group of politicians smuggling it in through a parliament, behind the backs of the population.

It will only be feasible when the mass of the population of Scotland, or of any other country, decides to take matters into its own hands. Passive support is not enough; like a house, socialism has to be built from the bottom up rather than from the top down.

Electing dedicated socialist politicians who are prepared to live the same lifestyle as ordinary working people is an important part of the battle to change society. But it is not enough. Unfortunately, the battle for the future of society won’t unfold like a game of cricket on the village green. The parasitic elite at the top of society will stop at nothing to protect their power and privileges. They will whip up hysteria. They will seek to suppress opposition.

But the working class in Scotland, which includes manual workers, white-collar workers, professional workers, pensioners, lone parents, and students, constitutes a mighty force.

Over 90 per cent of Scots have an income below £30,000 a year. 75 per cent have an income of less than £20,000 a year. By contrast, less than half of one per cent of Scots earned more than £90,000 a year.2

These raw figures expose the real balance of forces between the rich and the rest. As the 19th-century English revolutionary poet Percy Bysshe Shelley declared in his inspiring poem, ‘The Mask of Anarchy’, ‘We are many, ye are few.’

Even now, there is a growing gulf between, on the one side, the businessmen who run the country and politicians who think they run the country, and, on the other side, the people.

In late 1998, the findings of an extensive opinion survey were published in a newspaper. People were asked if they backed ‘higher taxes to provide better public services’; 73 per cent said yes. They were asked if they agreed with the statement that ‘there is one law for the rich and another for the poor’; 74 per cent said yes. They were asked whether ‘trade unions should have more of a say in the running of industry and the economy’; 51 per cent said yes.

Perhaps the most significant finding of all, given the sustained ideological onslaught that has been waged for the last ten years against the idea of socialism: 43 per cent of Scots agreed with the statement that ‘there should be more socialist planning’.

This was not a poll commissioned by the Scottish Socialist Voice or some other left-wing newspaper. It was not even commissioned by The Scotsman, which published the findings. It was conducted by the ICM polling organisation on behalf of … the Scottish Conservative Party!3

Others polls, including a recent Scottish Social Attitudes Survey, have shown huge majorities in favour of measures such as redistribution of wealth from the rich to the poor and the bringing back into public ownership of the privatised utilities and rail companies.

The double-barrelled devolution referendum in 1997 confounded many media commentators. They expected a majority Yes on the first question, which asked whether people agreed with the principle of a Scottish Parliament. But equally, they expected a No vote on the second question, which asked whether people wanted that parliament to have tax-raising powers. Journalists claimed that no electorate anywhere in the world had ever voted in favour of a general tax-raising mandate.

‘If Scotland votes Yes on the second question they will have gone where no modern electorate has gone before – and upset one of the laws of contemporary political behaviour,’ wrote one Scotsman commentator on the eve of the referendum. The next day, in a resounding rejection of the values of private greed over public need, the electorate voted by a two-to-one majority to go ‘where none had gone before’.

Not one of Scotland’s four traditional political parties would dare to promote such seditious policies as wealth redistribution, workers’ management or public ownership. Nor would any of Scotland’s mass circulation newspapers, TV stations, or radio stations ever give any credence to such fanatical extremism.

Yet these are mainstream ideas held by millions of ordinary people from all walks of life in Scotland today. Following a recent BBC Question Time programme filmed in Glasgow, the editor-in-chief of The Scotsman, Andrew Neil, could scarcely contain his rage at the left-wing attitudes expressed by the audience. ‘I have been around long enough to know that a Glasgow audience will be more left-wing than most,’ he fulminated. But this was ‘beyond the pale of mainstream politics even for Scotland … Throughout the programme not one voice spoke up for the market economy.’4

Those who live and work among real people in Scotland don’t have to watch Question Time to discover that the popularity of the market economy is a cosy myth dreamed up by newspaper moguls with six-figure salaries. What’s more, the ideas of socialism – of social equality, of people before profit, of open democracy rather than closed hierarchy – are growing in popularity, not just in Scotland but across the world.

In a fitting farewell to the last century, 100,000 people marched in Seattle, one of the richest cities in the world, against the world’s business and political elite. This was one of the biggest protest demos seen in the United States since the outpouring of rage against the Vietnam War in the 1960s. But what set the ‘Battle of Seattle’ apart from the thousands upon thousands of other protest actions of the last 50 years was its purpose. This was no single-issue movement, focusing on a specific injustice; this was a protest directed at the entire global capitalist system.

Since then, other similar actions have been organised in cities across the world. Protests, not just against poverty, not just against the destruction of the environment, not just against unemployment; but protests against all of these things, and against capitalism itself.

This is of immense significance. When resistance to capitalism is divided into different fragments labelled ‘animal-rights protest’, ‘trade-union protest’, ‘anti-road protest’, ‘anti-nuclear protest’, each can be picked off and defeated, just as the individual strands of a rope can easily be snapped. But when the protests are woven together, like the strands of a rope, they become stronger and less easily broken.

Veteran socialist firebrand Tony Benn used to observe that at left-wing demos and conferences, people would wear badges against the bomb, badges against low pay, badges against racism. ‘But when will people start wearing badges against capitalism?’ he asked. By the start of this century, more and more people across the globe were prepared to define themselves as ‘anti-capitalist’. That’s an important start, but it is only a start. We can oppose, resist, defy, obstruct, challenge, rebel against the system. But time and time again, the question will arise: ‘What is your alternative?’

The battle against capitalism is not just about action; it is also about ideology. It is about constructing an alternative vision that will inspire people to sweep aside all obstacles in order to turn that vision into reality. That doesn’t mean that we just preach the gospel of socialism and ask people to wait for the promised land. Socialists don’t just prepare for the future; we participate in the present.

Right now, socialists are fighting for the Scottish Parliament to redistribute wealth and income by introducing a new fairer form of local taxation based on ability to pay. Even though Holyrood has only limited powers, it could nonetheless scrap the Council Tax and introduce a Scottish Service Tax within two years, effectively raising the top rate of taxation in Scotland from 40 per cent to 52 per cent, and sharing this money out among low-income households. This would not eradicate poverty and inequality in Scotland. But, set against the last two decades of wealth redistribution from the poor to the rich, it would mark a turning of the tide. It would in all likelihood pave the way for further struggles, further changes, and further victories in the future.

Genuine socialists will always fight for reforms, for improvements, no matter how modest, in the lives of ordinary people. Those who stand aloof from the day-to-day struggle against oppression and exploitation will never gain the credibility to help shape the future. But one thing that differentiates conscious socialism from militant trade unionism, or from radical environmentalism, is that we have a clear goal, a definite destination. To reach that destination, we need audacity, but we also need clarity; we need courage, but we also need knowledge; we need conviction, but we also need vision.
