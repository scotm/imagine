IN CLOUD HOWE, the second part of Lewis Grassic Gibbon’s classic inter-war trilogy, A Scots Quair, the vision of 4000-year-old standing stones set against swirling clouds inspires the central character, Chris Guthrie, to think about the nature of time and change. The clouds that were once worshipped as gods, she thinks to herself, ‘are just clouds, they passed and finished, dissolved and were done, nothing endured but the Seeker himself and the everlasting hills’.1

Gibbon himself was an uncompromising socialist. As a philosophical Marxist, he knew that even the ‘everlasting hills’ would not endure. Nothing is permanent or infinite. Mountains, islands, seas, species, planets, solar systems come into being, change, and eventually disappear.

In nature, changes tend to be measured in millennia. By comparison, human society evolves at breakneck speed. Yet how often do we hear people say: ‘This is the way it’s always been. There’s no point in trying to change things.’ Because our lifespan is short, we often find it difficult to see the big picture. We imagine that capitalism is immortal because it’s been around for a few hundred years, which is tantamount to the blink of an eyelid when measured against millions of years of human existence. Yet, for many otherwise intelligent people, the system we live under today represents the final finished expression of civilisation. As the celebrated capitalist philosopher Francis Fukuyama puts it in his book, The End of History, capitalism is ‘the final form of human government’.2

Over and over again, the idea is drummed into our heads that capitalism is the natural order of civilisation and that ideals such as socialism, co-operation, and egalitarianism go against the grain of human nature. Selfishness and greed is deeply embedded in our genes, runs the argument, backed up in literature by books such as William Golding’s Lord of the Flies, where a group of boys marooned on an island revert to a Darwinian struggle for power culminating in the establishment of a ruthless hierarchy. Even the self-proclaimed socialist writer HG Wells wrote, ‘The theory of natural selection … has destroyed, quietly but entirely, the belief in human equality which is implicit in all the “liberalising” movements of the world.’

All of this is mumbo-jumbo. Of course there are plenty of examples of greed and selfishness, but there also lots of examples of generosity and self-sacrifice. Most people are neither purely good nor purely evil, neither purely selfish nor purely altruistic, neither purely social nor purely antisocial, but are all of these things jumbled together. Every day millions of people donate blood, put money into charity tins, console friends in distress, look after ageing neighbours, devote precious time to voluntary work, and generally act in a fashion that is the opposite of the behaviour depicted in Lord of the Flies.

It is true that we are, partly at least, a product of our genes, and genes exist for no other purpose than to survive and replicate themselves. But, as the acclaimed genetic scientist, Richard Dawkins – who even wrote a book called The Selfish Gene – has repeatedly explained, natural selection favours those genes that are able to co-operate with other genes. Indeed, when co-operation between genes breaks down, death and destruction occurs. And, in any case, as Dawkins himself forcefully argues, genes can’t think, they are mere molecules. Brains, on the other hand, which have been created from genes, can think and can consciously decide which social structures would be in the best interests of the majority of the population.

This argument about capitalism being in tune with human nature is an astonishingly enduring red herring. It overlooks the rather relevant fact that the earliest societies were organised on a communal basis. This wasn’t because the ancient tribesmen and women were more egalitarian than their descendants; it simply reflected the fact that resources were so scarce there was nothing extra to siphon off.

If a member of a hunting tribe managed to kill a wild boar, he couldn’t hoard it for himself or his immediate family. There were no deep-freezes in those days, so the hunter shared the spoils of the whole tribe on the understanding that, if someone else killed a large animal the next time, that too would be shared. The tribe also naturally co-operated with one other because that was the most efficient way to organise hunting and to ensure a steady supply of food.

What comes naturally – co-operation or rivalry – depends upon what is in the best interests of the majority in any given society. In different types of society, different value systems prevail. For example, in nomadic tribes, compulsory euthanasia of the elderly, the sick, and the frail was regarded in the past as natural. These tribes were forced to live a nomadic lifestyle because of the lack of vegetation in barren desert regions. Those who were elderly or infirm could not travel without imposing an intolerable burden on the rest of the tribe. And, no doubt, people living in these nomadic tribes imagined that compulsory euthanasia was part and parcel of human nature and would continue forever.

People have always found it difficult to rise above their immediate surroundings and visualise anything new or unfamiliar. Back in the Dark Ages, if anyone had suggested to our cave-dwelling ancestors that one day we would be living in gigantic cities with street lights and cars and telephones, they would have been laughed at.

When Spartacus led a slave uprising in Ancient Rome 2000 years ago, there would have been voices of common sense telling him that he was wasting his time. ‘C’mon, Spartacus, get a grip! There’s always been slavery. It’s human nature to have slaves and slave-owners, and you can’t change human nature!’

Throughout human history, there have always been people who cling to the past. Usually, but not exclusively, these are the people with wealth and power. They fear change, they resist progress, they grow nervous when confronted with ideas that are new and unfamiliar.

There are other people who thrive on change. They live, not in the past, or even in the present, but in the future. They refuse to worship before the altar of tradition. They challenge, and sometimes even break, the rules.

Nicolas Copernicus, for example, rewrote the rules of astronomy and was denounced from every pulpit in Europe because he challenged the universally accepted truth that the Earth was the centre of the Universe and everything else revolved around it. Beethoven rewrote the rules of music. Shakespeare rewrote the rules of literature and even morality. Napoleon rewrote the rules of warfare. Picasso rewrote the rules of art. Darwin rewrote the rules of biology. Newton rewrote the rules of physics.

Every great advance that has ever been achieved in art, science, literature, or music has depended upon people of vision and courage who have been prepared to stand up to the prevailing orthodoxies. At the start of the 21st century, the idea of a new social system based on equality, co-operation, solidarity, and democracy requires a certain leap of the imagination because such a society has never yet been built.

Most people are neither hidebound conservatives nor swashbuckling revolutionaries. They would rather settle for an easy life and leave the hard thinking to others. And that’s exactly what they’re encouraged to do by the people in power – because the more that ordinary people start to think things out for themselves, the more likely they are to challenge the status quo. ‘If it ain’t broken, don’t fix it’ is the guiding philosophy of many people. That’s fair enough. But the social system we live under is broken and it’s beyond repair. It can only be replaced.

Throughout history, there has been a whole succession of different social systems. Ancient tribal societies made way for slavery, which in turn was replaced by feudalism. All were progressive in their time. But they eventually ceased being progressive and were overthrown because they began to act as obstacles blocking the way forward.

Sometimes elements of the old system continued to co-exist alongside the new. Many of the Highland clans continued to operate a form of primitive communism after feudalism had conquered the Lowlands; slavery was only abolished in the United States towards the end of the 19th century; and the remnants of feudalism still exist in the United Kingdom today in the form of the monarchy, the House of Lords, and the landed aristocracy. But the general trend has always been for society to progress from a lower stage to a higher stage as it develops economically.

In its time capitalism represented a revolutionary leap forward. It challenged outdated traditions, smashed aside the rigid hierarchical structures of feudalism, and paved the way for the explosive development of science and industry. Without the overthrow of feudalism, the world’s population today would be a fraction of its present size. Billions of people alive today would never have been born, because the technical means could never have been developed under feudalism to support such a large population. And of course, there would be no electricity, no motor vehicles, no air travel, no railways, no telephones, no computers, no TVs, no hypermarkets.

Many people, especially the capitalists themselves, claim that capitalism still plays a progressive role. They acknowledge that the system can suffer periodic booms and busts, upswings and downswings, recessions and recoveries. They even admit that the system creates gross inequality. But they insist that, for all its flaws, it does deliver the goods. Even if economic growth is punctuated with interruptions from time to time, the curve is climbing steadily upwards. So how can capitalism possibly be written off as an impediment to progress?

From the standpoint of pure economics, pure statistics, pure quantity of production, these claims have some validity. In terms of sheer quantity, capitalism today produces ten times as much as it did in the middle of the 20th century. It’s also true that almost every day, especially in the field of computer technology, we see new innovations. But economic and technical progress no longer automatically equates with social progress.

For thousands of centuries, the basic task of humankind was to control nature and increase the productivity of labour. The invention of primitive tools, then more sophisticated tools, then machines, then large-scale industry all led to increases in production which benefited society as a whole. Of course, some people benefited much more than others; in parts of Africa today, economic progress might as well have halted some time back in the Middle Ages for all the impact it’s had on the lives of ordinary people.

Nonetheless, as a general rule, economic and social progress historically marched forward hand in hand. But now the relationship has broken down. Under capitalism, the couple have drifted apart and gone their separate ways.

At least when the old-style industrialists introduced new techniques to maximise their profits, these technical advances tended to have spin-off benefits for society as a whole. Early capitalism was forced to develop a basic education system to ensure that people could cope in an industrialised urban environment. It was forced to provide public transport, public housing, basic medication, sanitation. Living standards and conditions steadily improved and working hours were gradually reduced.

Of course these improvements were not graciously handed down from on high by the capitalist owners of industry; they had to be fought for. Moreover, countries like Britain benefited from the imperial plunder of Africa and Asia. But technological progress did enable capitalism to concede reforms.

Today, technology enables capitalism to dismantle reforms. It is used to force down wages, increase hours, and destroy jobs. It is used by multimillionaires to hold national governments to ransom. It has created a massive surplus population – described by sociologists as ‘the underclass’ – which is forced to resort to the black economy, crime, and drug dealing in order to survive.

Capitalism may still be capable of economic progress. But the price of that progress will be even more environmental destruction, even more inequality, even more intensified, exploitation of labour, even more deregulation, even more anti-trade-union legislation, even more privatisation, even more unemployment, even more crime, even more violence. In other words, the price of economic progress in the 21st century will be social disintegration.

There is now a mind-boggling imbalance between the fantastic possibilities of social progress represented by new technology, and its ruinous consequences in practice for those sections of society excluded from the information revolution.

At this stage many people are fearful of change. The idea of tearing down the walls of capitalism and constructing a brand-new society on different foundations is a daunting prospect. Socialism seems like a gigantic leap in the dark. Isn’t it better to stick with the devil you know?

That may seem like an easy option for many people right now. Like Harold MacMillan back in the 1950s, today’s politicians tell us we’ve never had it so good. The economy is booming, although by the time you read these words, the boom may have turned into a recession or something even more severe. Like the Scottish weather, capitalism is a highly volatile system. Today’s sunshine can turn into tomorrow’s storm.

But, for the moment, let’s give the economists the benefit of the doubt. Let’s concede that the laws that have governed capitalism from its inception have been abolished, or at least temporarily suspended. Let’s suppose there are no downswings, recessions, crashes, or slumps anywhere on the radar screen, and consider the best capitalism has to offer after 200 years of progress.

On the positive side, technology has provided millions in the wealthiest countries with a reasonable standard of living. Many of us are able to afford TVs, videos, central heating, microwave ovens, cars, computers, dishwashers, the occasional holiday abroad. In Scotland, as in most other Western European countries, we still have a welfare state, a National Health Service, and free education for all children. Not as good a welfare state or NHS as we used to have, mind you, but at least they still exist.

On the negative side, we have mass destitution in the Southern Hemisphere, where most of the world’s population live. Indeed, the global north-south wealth gap has more than doubled over the past 50 years. Wars and ethnic barbarism engulf whole tracts of our planet. A nuclear arsenal has been developed which is capable of wiping out all human, animal, and plant life. Environmentalists warn of imminent global catastrophe.

In the rich countries, people are plagued by anxiety and insecurity. They live in constant dread of what tomorrow might bring. Many of us are up to our ears in debt. Our job is not as secure as it once was. We work long hours and have little time to ourselves. Working women with families live in a state of perpetual exhaustion. In our rural communities, increasing numbers of farmers are driven to suicide because of debt, poverty, and bankruptcy. In our cities, crime, drug abuse, alcohol abuse, child abuse, and domestic violence run rampant. Homeless people beg on our street corners. Our pensioners are worse off today than they were 20 years ago. Asthma among our children escalates to epidemic levels as the air we breathe becomes more and more poisonous.

And this is capitalism on a good day. This is capitalism after a decade-long upswing which is being hailed by the economists as ‘an economic miracle’. This is capitalism at its most confident and optimistic.

‘I’ll tell you what I want, what I really, really want’ sang the Spice Girls at the height of their fame in the late 1990s. But what do people really, really want? A few years ago, an organisation called the Women’s Communication Centre carried out the largest ever survey of women’s opinion. They asked tens of thousands of women the simple question ‘What do you want out of life?’

A number of answers were repeated over and over again by thousands of women. They wanted clean air. A more equitable society. Time to do all the things they always wanted to do. Enough money to pay the bills, feed and clothe the children, and have a reasonable standard of living without constantly worrying about debt. Freedom from the drudgery of housework. Good health. Better working conditions. A shorter working week. A better education for their children. Access to education for themselves. An end to wars. An end to starvation. Peace of mind. Freedom from fear. Better public transport. More smiling faces. A happier world. More public celebration. Toleration. The right to live their own lives without being dictated to by others. A house with physical space and a garden.3

In this day and age, these demands are perfectly reasonable. Yet, as things stand right now, they appear unrealistic. That’s because we suffer from stunted vision and poverty of the imagination. We can’t end starvation in the Third World, we can’t reduce the working week, we can’t provide an adequate minimum wage, we can’t provide decent housing for everyone, because the accountants who run the system on behalf of the rich tell us that we can’t afford these things.

The truth is, all of these things and much, much more can be achieved by organising society differently. ‘Imagine all the people sharing the world,’ sang by John Lennon 30 years ago. ‘Imagine all the people living life in peace.’

‘But this is utopianism!’ shriek the conservatives and the conformists. Oscar Wilde once issued a sharp retort to those who lacked the imagination to contemplate the possibility that things could be different: ‘Show me a map without Utopia on it, and I’ll show you a map that’s not worth looking at.’

In the middle of the 15th century, Thomas More wrote a book called Utopia, in which he set out a vision of a society in which all property was socially owned. Contrary to popular mythology, modern socialism does not call for the abolition of personal property. Nonetheless, in some respects, More was half a millennium in advance of his time.

In the last four and a half centuries, there has been such a colossal development of science, industry, agriculture, education, and culture that the idea of common ownership, of egalitarianism, of the brotherhood and the sisterhood of man and woman is no longer utopian or absurd. What is absurd is the idea that the economic system we live under today will go on until the end of time.

Politics should be more than a series of petty squabbles between rival parties who share an identical, narrow vision of society. It should be about ideals and principles, philosophy and morals, economics and history, values and beliefs. This book does not lay any claim to political infallibility. The ideas set out here are not tablets of stone. Their purpose is to provoke a wide-ranging ideological debate the length and breadth of Scotland, and further afield.

Some of the detailed arguments set out here will no doubt be picked over like fishbones and criticised. But the key question is this: Which side are you on? Private greed or social need? Profits or people? Inequality or fairness? Hierarchy or democracy? Capitalism or socialism?
