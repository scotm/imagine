In a TV poll last year, viewers were asked to vote for the greatest song of the millennium. To my great delight, the winner was John Lennon’s powerful and haunting song, ‘Imagine’.

When he wrote ‘Imagine’, Lennon was going through an intensely political phase. He had marched against the Vietnam War, spoken out against global poverty, and donated money to the Upper Clyde Shipbuilders’ work-in. The song itself evokes the vision of a socialist world, a world free from inequality, exploitation, racism, and war.

When we were racking our brains to come up with a title for this book, I suggested it be called Imagine. When the song was first released, I was still in my early years at primary school. Yet the ideals that inspired Lennon to write his celebrated song seem to me to have even greater resonance today than ever before.

The idea for this book first materialised towards the end of 1999. Soon after my election to the Scottish Parliament, I had undertaken a gruelling speaking tour of Scotland.

From draughty village halls in remote corners of the Highlands to fortified community centres in run-down city housing schemes, I had travelled thousands of miles and spoken to thousands of people. Socialism is supposed to be dead and buried with its ashes scattered to the four winds. Yet people were turning out in droves to these meetings, not to discuss some immediate pressing issue that affected their everyday lives, but to hear the general case for a socialist Scotland.

Even after 20 years of being bombarded from all sides with propaganda in support of the capitalist market economy, it is remarkable how many people remain attracted to the idea of building a new socialist society. Like John Lennon, they dream of something better.

Wherever I travelled, a few questions kept recurring. What exactly do you mean by socialism? In what ways would it be different from capitalism? Would a socialist Scotland be viable in a world economy run by giant multinational companies? And how do we go about changing society? Where do we start?

In a 30-minute speech, it’s not possible to provide in-depth answers to these profound questions. It’s only possible to scratch the surface. Yet many people are crying out for new ideas, for an alternative ideology. They look at the world they live in and they don’t like what they see. They know what they are against; but they’re not sure what they’re for.

I discussed this with Alan McCombes, with whom I’ve worked closely over the years through numerous campaigns and political battles. We’ve laughed together, been locked up together, marched together, and been on hunger strike together. Alan is a man of action, but also a man of words. A talented socialist journalist, Alan became the founding editor in 1996 of the Scottish Socialist Voice, which is widely acclaimed as the best socialist newspaper on sale anywhere in Britain.

More than anyone, Alan has been at the cutting edge of developing and updating the ideas of socialism in Scotland, making them relevant to the 21st century. Working with him on this book was an education.

We bounced around a few ideas and eventually decided to write this book presenting the alternative to capitalism in a more in-depth way. We were clear that we didn’t want to try to produce some academic treatise written for the benefit of economists or sociologists. Instead, we aimed to explain the case for an independent socialist Scotland and a global challenge to the rule of capitalism in language that ordinary people will understand.

The intention of this book is not just to argue the intellectual and moral case for socialism, but also to inspire people to get involved in the day-to-day fight to improve the lives of their families and communities.

In this book, we have tried to paint the big picture. But we also know that the struggle to transform society is a colossal project which will take years, perhaps decades, to accomplish. It won’t be achieved in one big bang.

Socialism is about ideals and vision, but it is also about taking sides in the struggle against injustice and exploitation that is raging every day in workplaces and communities across Scotland and across the globe. Socialists are not just preachers seeking to convert people to the idea of a new form of society. We are also warriors fighting always on the side of the weak against the strong, on the side of the poor against the rich, on the side of the underdog against the powerful.

Sometimes it can seem that the odds are stacked hopelessly in favour of the rich and powerful, who have the legal, political, business, and media Establishment on their side. Yet, if we stand up for our beliefs with conviction and courage, we can win.

That’s what the anti-Poll-Tax campaign showed. In the early days of that campaign, a whole procession of Labour politicans and leaders marched around Scotland, whipping up apathy and inciting defeatism. By contrast, ordinary people got themselves organised, took on the combined might of the Thatcher government, Labour-controlled councils, and the legal establishment, and brought the Poll Tax crashing down.

The reverberations of that victory are still resonating across Scotland. In early 1992, I stood before three High Court judges for defying a court order to stop Scotland’s first attempted Poll Tax warrant sale. I had never actually seen a warrant sale taking place.   But hatred of this medieval debt-recovery procedure is rooted in the folklore of working-class Scotland. My Gran, who lives in Govan, once told me a story of how a neighbour had returned from work to the sight of the contents of his home piled up outside his close. He ran upstairs, thinking that maybe there had been a fire. Instead he found his wife sobbing inconsolably. Their bits and pieces of chipped furniture stood on the pavement overnight, on display for everyone to see before the traders arrived to bid for them next morning.

For me, as for most people in Scotland, the Poll Tax itself was a disgrace, a barefaced attempt to transfer even more wealth from the poor to the rich. But the method now being used to recover Poll-Tax debts was even more inhuman. Two centuries ago, Scotland’s national poet Robert Burns denounced the 18th-century forerunners of today’s sheriff officers:

> ‘They’ll stamp and threaten, curse and swear, Apprehend you, poind your gear.’

[a]  I had been served with a court order banning me from the vicinity of the police headquarters in Turnbull Street in the East End of Glasgow, where the sale was scheduled to take place on October 1, 1991. But there are times when you have to make hard choices. My hatred of warrant sales far outweighed my fear of the legal consequences.

Along with 300 other anti-Poll-Tax activists, I marched into the courtyard where the sale was due to take place one hour later. I then tore up the interdict in full view of the TV cameras and called upon the assembled crowd to resist the warrant sale. And resist they did. The demonstrators surged forward towards the van, which contained the personal bits and pieces of a Greenock family. The massed ranks of blue uniforms were overwhelmed. The warrant sale was called off and, as the news was broadcast on local radio news bulletins, it seemed that the whole of Glasgow was cheering us to the rafters. ‘VICTORY!’ screamed the front-page banner headline in the Glasgow Evening Times.

A few months later, it was time to face the music. ‘In a democratic society it is the rule of law that shields it from anarchy and mob rule … many forms of political protest are available but ignoring court orders and obstructing sheriff officers are not among their number,’ proclaimed Lord Caplan, pomposity oozing from every pore as he delivered the sentence – six months’ imprisonment.

Eight years later I stood on Edinburgh’s Royal Mile, just a few hundred yards from the courtroom from which I had been led handcuffed, bound for Saughton Prison. But I was now an elected MSP, and I’m proud to say that I achieved that position without compromising or diluting a single principle.

Once again, I was surrounded by photographers, journalists, and TV crews. But this time round, I was being treated like a hero rather than a villain. The Bill I had introduced to outlaw warrant sales and poindings had just provoked the first full-scale mutiny in the year-old Scottish Parliament and was now on course to become law.

Just as I had been singled out for special punishment years before, I was now being singled out for special praise. I deserved neither. The defeat of Scotland’s first attempted warrant sale at Turnbull Street had been a glorious victory. It was a turning point in the battle to make the Tory Poll Tax uncollectable. But there were 300 people there that day, and every one of them played a heroic role in stopping that attempted warrant sale from going ahead.

As a Scottish Socialist MSP I initiated the Bill to abolish warrant sales and poindings. But I had received crucial backing from fellow MSPs, John McAllion and Alex Neil. I had been provided with indispensable expert guidance from solicitor Mike Dailly. Voluntary organisations, too, had thrown their weight behind the Bill. The Scottish Socialist Party had mobilised public support for the Bill up and down Scotland. And, before the Scottish Socialist Party was even formed, the Scottish Anti-Poll Tax Federation had fought the sheriff officers to a standstill in a guerrilla war without bullets which had raged across Scotland for the best part of a decade.

The removal of this centuries-old piece of repressive legislation was not a personal victory for one individual; it was a collective victory fought and won by thousands of ordinary people after a decade of struggle.

There are two powerful lessons that I believe should be learned from our successful struggle to end the shameful practice of warrant sales and poindings. The first is that we should never assume that just because some people have money, or status, or power, or titles, or even wigs and gowns, that they are right and we are wrong.

The other lesson is that the battle against injustice has to be waged on all fronts. The mainstream political parties are fixated with elected posts. Some politicians may occasionally participate in this or that demonstration. But everything is subordinated to the winning of positions in government. Elections, parliaments, councils, are the be-all and end-all and everything else is a distraction.

Some politicians act with the best of intentions, others with the worst of intentions. But most are united in their aim of grabbing power and running things from on high while the lower orders look on in admiration. ‘Leave politics to the politicians’ is the unspoken message that they convey.

There are a growing number of people who are now reacting in the opposite direction. Many of the young people protesting on the streets of Seattle, Washington, and London against global capitalism reject politics out of hand. They are so filled with contempt for the politicians that they deny the legitimacy of any elections, any parliaments, any form of organised politics.

I can understand where they are coming from. They are justified in treating politicians and political parties with suspicion. The American tycoon, Henry Ford, who pioneered mass production of motor cars, had a favourite catchphrase: ‘You can have any colour of car you like,’ he said, ‘as long as it’s black!’ These days, cars come in all colours, shapes and sizes. But our politicians tend to come in one colour – monochrome grey. In the four big political parties, the grey men in the grey suits hold sway at every level.

Young people are right to take to the streets. Some of these protests have occasionally got out of hand, providing an excuse for sleek politicians to appear on TV to denounce the ‘anarchy and disorder’. Personally, I would rather young people were out protesting against capitalism than shooting heroin into their veins in a back alley, or carving each other up with broken bottles after a Saturday night on the booze. But what the Establishment fears more than anything else is the fusion of direct action with political struggle to win over the hearts and minds of the majority of the population.

The battle to transform society will only be victorious with the active involvement of millions of ordinary people. We won’t change society simply by convincing people to vote for us; although that’s part of it, because if we can’t convince people to vote for change, neither will we be able to convince them to struggle for change.

This book is about trying to raise people’s sights beyond the humdrum day-to-day concerns that all of us have. It is a call to everyone in Scotland to look beyond the gloss and the hype of modern capitalism and to consider the possibility that things could be different.

The great black American civil-rights campaigner, Martin Luther King, once offered up his dream of the future: ‘Some day children will learn words whose meanings they do not understand. Children in India will ask, “What is hunger?” Children in Hiroshima will ask, “What is an atomic bomb?” Children in Alabama will ask, “What is segregation?” And we will say to them, “These are words that no longer have meaning, so we have removed them from the dictionary.”’

Is it too far-fetched to dream that one day children growing up in Scotland will ask, ‘What was poverty? What was deprivation? What was homelessness?’ Or that children growing up in Central Europe will ask, ‘What was ethnic cleansing? What was torture? What was war?’ Or that children all over the world will ask, ‘What was famine? What was inequality? What was exploitation?’
