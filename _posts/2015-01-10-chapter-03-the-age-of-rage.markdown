TIM STONE WAS once a brilliant scientist specialising in lung diseases. He earned a comfortable salary, lived in a luxury mansion with his wife and children and was so renowned in his field that he was even listed in the Who’s Who in the World next to Sharon Stone, the film actress. When Scotland’s Education Minister, Sam Galbraith, fell seriously ill after contracting a rare lung disease, Tim Stone helped find a cure.

But then, all of a sudden, Tim’s world was turned upside down. The Freeman Hospital in Newcastle, where he worked, told him his services were no longer required. After being made redundant, he was unable to find another job. The type of work he did was highly specialised, performed by just 12 people in the whole of the UK.

His life began to fall apart. He hit the bottle and soon became an alcoholic. His marriage collapsed. He ran up huge debts and lost his home. His health deteriorated and he was diagnosed with mouth cancer. Towards the end of 1999, he was found dead after falling from a balcony. There was a suggestion that he had been fleeing from people from whom he had borrowed money.

At the inquest into his death, Tim’s step-daughter blamed the NHS for his death. ‘We are certain of one thing,’ she said. ‘None of this would have happened if he had not lost his job.’[1](../references/notes.html#chapter-3-1)

Most economists and politicians would confess that there is inequality at the two opposite extremes of wealth and poverty. But the rest of us are supposed to have become comfortably incorporated into the middle classes. Some sociologists talk of the ‘diamond-shaped society’ – with a small ultra-rich ‘overclass’ at the top, a small impoverished ‘underclass’ at the bottom, and a big wide swathe in the middle.

They point to the changed make-up of the workforce in Scotland and other developed countries as evidence to support this proposition. It’s certainly true that there have been big changes over the past couple of decades. For example, in the 1950s there were over 100,000 coal miners in Scotland. Now they have become almost an extinct species, as central to our modern economy as barber’s pole painters, chimney sweeps and bookies’ runners.

On Clydeside, there were once 100,000 shipyard workers; today there are more people making a living from selling illegal drugs than from building ships. Call centres and fast-food outlets have begun to replace the engineering factories and steelworks that once formed the bedrock of the Scottish economy. Across Britain as a whole, more people work in Indian restaurants than in coal mining, steel manufacturing and shipbuilding combined.

But the working class is not just made up of shipyard workers, coal miners, mill workers, car assembly workers, bricklayers and such-like. It is a much broader social formation, involving a vast assortment of people with diverse lifestyles and working conditions. It includes more or less everyone who works for an employer, from fast-food sellers to fashion models, from orchestral musicians to office cleaners, from computer programmers to college lecturers.

Contrary to the mythology that we are fed by politicians and sociologists, the working class is not vanishing; nor is the middle class growing. In fact, the trend is moving in exactly the opposite direction. As the example of Tim Stone illustrates, the solid middle ground of society is gradually turning to quicksand.

In the past, big sections of the unskilled manual working class lived a precarious existence. Dockers, for example, used to queue up at the quayside whenever a ship arrived in port, hoping desperately to be chosen for a few days’ work by the foreman. Building workers have always drifted from job to job, and often from city to city, in search of short-term work.

But, especially from the Second World War onwards, the vast majority of workers began to enjoy a reasonably stable and secure lifestyle with a regular wage, paid holidays and paid sick leave. Many people would start work at 15 and retire 50 years later from the same firm. Even those who were made redundant could at least expect a sizeable lump-sum payment, to tide them over until they found another job.

But times are changing rapidly. ‘You can’t expect a job for life,’ we are now told, often by wealthy businessmen who inherit their businesses from their parents and will in turn hand their businesses down to their children. A whole new business vocabulary has been constructed, including terms such as ‘the flexible labour market’, ‘casualisation’, ‘deregulation’, ‘contracting out’, ‘competitive tendering’, ‘downsizing’, ‘performance-related pay’, ‘outsourcing’. Just as the Eskimoes have 100 words for snow, the corporate slavedrivers of the 21st century have 100 different euphemisms for exploitation.

In his book, False Dawn: Delusions of Global Capitalism Professor John Gray of the London School of Economics points out: ‘For much of the population, traditional bourgeois institutions such as career structures and vocations no longer exist. The result is a re-proletarianisation of much of the industrial working class and the debourgeoisification of what remains of the former middle classes.’ Or, to put it in more everyday language, the working class is becoming more and more working class … and the middle class is becoming less and less middle class.

According to the 1999 survey of British Social Attitudes, 60 per cent of workers in the UK are unhappy in their jobs. They report feelings of exhaustion, stress, and insecurity. Psychologists warn of the intensifying pressure and strain which are taking their toll on the physical and mental health of millions.

No-one can dispute the fact that material living standards, particularly for skilled and professional workers, have improved over the past decade or so. There are higher levels of home ownership and car ownership than ever before. A whole new range of consumer goods, such as videos, dishwashers, microwave ovens and personal computers, have become widely available in recent years.

But these modest gains disguise the fact that the working class is being exploited more ruthlessly and systematically than ever before. American economist John Schmitt points out that the average American worker produces 12 per cent more in the course of an hour’s work than ten years ago.[2](../references/notes.html#chapter-3-2) Yet, allowing for inflation, wages have increased by less than two per cent.

Meanwhile, a report by the banking company Merrill Lynch admits that the minimum wage in the US has fallen by 20 per cent in real terms over the past 20 years.[3](../references/notes.html#chapter-3-3) The general trend across all the developed countries has been more or less the same. In Spain, the economy doubled in size over 20 years; yet the numbers in employment fell by eight per cent. Right across the globe, people are working harder and longer for less pay and in worsening conditions.

This is a startling turnaround. In the past, even when times were tough, people looked forward to the future with confidence. ‘Things Can Only Get Better’ was New Labour’s cynical theme tune during the 1997 general election. But for generation after generation throughout the 20th century, that really was the prevailing belief.

There was a feeling among all classes in society – at least in developed countries such as Britain and the US – that tomorrow would be better than today, that next year would be better than this year, that the next generation would have a better life than this generation.

That sense of optimism was well grounded. One American economist, Robert Lawrence, has calculated that, from 1870 until 1970, living standards doubled every 35 years. Each generation was approximately twice as well off as the preceding generation.[4](../references/notes.html#chapter-3-4)

In Britain, there was a similar sense of eternal progress, especially in the post-war years. The NHS was founded, making free health care available to everyone for the first time in history. The welfare state was established, providing a safety net to ensure that no-one would starve. Huge resources were ploughed into education. Slums were torn down and replaced with gleaming new housing schemes with baths and inside toilets. Unemployment seemed to have been banished forever, and the Great Depression of the 1930s became a distant folk memory. ‘You’ve never had it so good,’ said Tory Prime Minister, Harold Macmillan, with some justification.

Now people look to the future with foreboding. They live in houses that they can’t really afford. They drive cars that they can’t really afford. They buy clothes and household goods that they can’t really afford. They work incredibly long hours and pile up terrifyingly large debts in order to live the lifestyle they are told they must have.

And, notwithstanding the cheerful twitterings of most politicians, there is a growing body of opinion that insists that things can only get worse.

A number of sociologists and economists warn of the mass elimination of tens of millions of jobs across the developed countries as a result of automation. Jeremy Rifkin, President of the Washington DC-based Foundation on Economic Trends, who has written extensively on the impact of new technology on the workforce, maintains that ‘the shift from mass to elite labour forces is what distinguishes work in the Information Age from work in the Industrial Age’.

Predicting the disappearance of scores of occupations, including assembly-line work, clerical work, bank telling, telephone operating, and many others, Rifkin warns ‘With near workerless factories and virtual companies already looming on the horizon, every nation will have to grapple with the question of what to do with the millions of people whose labour is needed less, or not at all.’[5](../references/notes.html#chapter-3-5)

More brutally, Professor Ian Angell of the London School of Economics, who provides advice to some of the world’s biggest multinational corporations on future trends in society, sketches out a chilling vision of a new Frankenstein capitalism, where the advance of technology, instead of liberating the human race, causes the virtual collapse of civilisation. ‘The lights are going out for wide sectors of society and for whole categories of employment. We are entering a new Dark Age: an age of hopelessness, an Age of Rage.’

The Professor insists that a new industrial revolution has begun which will leave most of the population surplus to requirements as a new intellectual, business, and cultural elite rises to the top. ‘Mass production methods needed an over-supply of humanity – now there is a glut,’ he says, quite matter-of-factly. He goes on, ‘A large population, particularly an uneducated and ageing population, has now become the major problem.’

Not that Professor Angell loses too much sleep over the fate of those whom he decries as ‘society’s losers’. He describes taxation of business as ‘state-sponsored extortion’. He lauds the fact that the rich are getting richer and the poor poorer, and says that ‘the call for fairness is the mere whingeing of failures and parasites.’

Alarmingly, Professor Angell insists, ‘The biggest challenge of the coming decades is how to find an acceptable means to scale back democracy.’ This is taboo territory for most politicians, so the man should at least be commended for his honesty. Indeed, it’s clear that the arrogant professor is simply blurting out publicly ideas which many global political and business leaders privately adhere to.

Fortunately, Professor Angell’s analysis of the impact of technology on society is one-sided, leading him to paint an exaggeratedly apocalyptic picture. For example, he states that ‘The Marxist myth that labour creates wealth will be buried once and for all … it is that rare commodity, human intellect, which is the stuff of tomorrow’s world.’[6](../references/notes.html#chapter-3-6)

It is a delusion to imagine that even in the new Information Age, businessmen, intellectuals, and machines can supplant the traditional working class as the backbone of the economy and society. It’s true that electronic communications and the development of high-speed data-processing techniques have boosted productivity and have increased all-round efficiency. This, along with the driving down of labour costs through deregulation and globalisation, has led to a profits bonanza for big business and a prolonged economic upswing in the USA and Europe.

On the other hand, Information Technology doesn’t actually produce anything. It does generate demand for computers and associated products. But these in turn are manufactured in factories by assembly-line workers. They are transported around countries and continents by lorry drivers. They are shipped between countries and continents by seafarers.

Without the labourers who dig up the roads and lay the cables, there would be no Internet. These billions of miles of cables and wiring also have to be manufactured in factories by workers. Without technicians to connect and maintain these cables, the Internet would soon cease to function.

Without power workers, oil workers, miners, and other employees in the energy-generating industries, there would be no computers because there would be no electricity. The offices which house the computers’ work are not constructed on the screen of an Apple Mac, they are built by joiners, glaziers, labourers, bricklayers, painters, and a multitude of other construction workers.

Bins can’t be emptied by computers, fires can’t be fought over the Internet, and no software program that will ever be devised could possibly replace doctors, nurses, midwives, and other health workers.

Without farmers and fishermen, without waiters and waitresses, the new intellectual, business, and cultural elite would be unable to enjoy expensive meals in upmarket restaurants. Nor could they travel by road, sea, air, or rail, because none of these systems could be run or maintained without transport workers. And without water and sewage workers, the new intellectual elite would eventually be wiped out by disease.

Some commentators predict that eventually online shopping will replace, or at least seriously undermine, the entire retail trade. But even online shopping requires drivers and postal workers to deliver the goods that are purchased by email.

Yet there are important grains of truth in Professor Angell’s apocalyptic projections. Huge swathes of businesses face the prospect of total wipe-out as the information revolution accelerates. Skilled and unskilled jobs will be wiped out in their hundreds of millions across the Northern Hemisphere. Sectors such as banking and finance will be especially vulnerable with some analysts calculating that, within a decade or so, 150,000 banking jobs in the UK will be wiped out.

This would have an especially devastating effect on Scotland’s main financial centre, Edinburgh, which could eventually suffer the fate that its West Coast neighbour suffered back in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Heavy industry fled Glasgow during that time, and the resulting collapse of the economy has left behind a terrible legacy of poverty and deprivation which endures to this day.

As online shopping becomes more popular, employment in the retail industry and in the packaging industry, which is largely geared towards making products recognisable on the retail shelves, is likely to be decimated.

Call centres, which now employ 35,000 people in Scotland, are especially vulnerable to the onslaught of online services. Even the pitifully low-paid jobs in the fast-food shops are likely to vanish as McDonald’s, Burger King, Kentucky Fried Chicken, and the rest of the big franchises switch to computerised vending machines.

The provision of online services at the cheapest rates is also likely to lead to the collapse of many smaller businesses which employ reasonably well-paid workers. One online company now offers printing services to any company or organisation anywhere in the world, from design right through to distribution, at cheaper prices than any established printers could hope to match.

There is no possibility that these jobs will be replaced by new hi-tech jobs in the computer and electronics industries. Scotland’s Silicon Glen, for example, today employs just 30,000 people, which is 10,000 fewer than it employed 20 years ago.

Nine out of ten of these jobs consist of desperately low-paid soul-destroying assembly-line work. Back in 1996, a BBC documentary, Frontline Scotland, revealed that Scotland’s electronics workers had the lowest pay, the longest hours, and the worst conditions of any electronics workers in the developed world. Almost half had a take-home pay of under £160 for a 44-hour week. Conditions today in ‘Sweatshop Glen’ are no better.[7](../references/notes.html#chapter-3-7)

Politicians and economists frequently speak in awe-stricken tones about the miraculous Silicon Valley in California. They conjure up images of a vast belt of affluence, where hundreds of thousands of workers drive home in expensive cars every evening from their gleaming hi-tech offices to their plush detached villas.

The real Silicon Valley bears no resemblance to this mythical wonderland. Most of the workforce are black or Hispanic and live in abject poverty. At $8 an hour, the wages are higher than in Silicon Glen. But in that part of the US, the cost of living is so exorbitant that it can cost an entire month’s salary to rent a single-apartment flat.

Meanwhile, software companies like Microsoft have emerged as the all-powerful global giants of the early 21st century. But they do not generate employment. The combined workforce of Microsoft, Oracle, and Computer Associates – the three largest software companies in America – is less than one tenth the total workforce of the largest car company, General Motors. A new company set up in Britain by BT, the Bank of Scotland, and a computer software company is poised to dominate the market in international telephone calls by offering a combination of advanced computer technology and cheaper phone calls. The company, Quip, has its headquarters in Milton Keynes, and has a total workforce of just 15.

How different the reality of 21st-century capitalism is from the expectations of earlier generations of political leaders. Back in 1964, the newly elected Labour Prime Minister, Harold Wilson, forecast that ‘the white heat of technology’ would slash the length of the working week. He forecast that by the year 2000 there would be a maximum 20-hour working week as a consequence of technological progress.

Yet, 36 years on, the average blue-collar worker in Britain works four and a half hours a week longer than in 1964. White-collar workers also work longer hours and are under more stress and strain than ever before. As Psychology Professor Cary Cooper of the University of Manchester Institute for Science and Technology points out, ‘We have moved into a culture of short-term contracts, job insecurity, work overload and long hours.’[8](../references/notes.html#chapter-3-8)

In the intervening period since Harold Wilson made his bold prediction, technology has advanced into the realms of what would have seemed like science fiction back then. Yet the dream of a 20-hour working week appears about as far-fetched as Dr Who’s Tardis seemed to schoolchildren back in 1964.
