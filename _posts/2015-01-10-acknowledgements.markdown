Many people – too many to list – have contributed in some measure to the development of this book.

Especially we want to thank Catriona Grant, Rosie Kane, Peter Murray, and Eddie Truman, who have all provided valuable factual information; Felicity Garvie, for her painstaking organisational support; Kath Kyle, for taking on much of the responsibility for the production of the Scottish Socialist Voice, freeing Alan McCombes to work on this book.

Kevin Williamson, the commissioning editor of Rebel Inc, is one of Scotland’s great pioneering publishers. His help and advice have been indispensable.

Finally, we would like to thank the many socialist activists in Scotland and further afield who have battled on valiantly to keep the flame alive, even during the tough times. Your courage has been an inspiration. Your time will come.
